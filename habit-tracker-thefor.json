It does what you want it do, track habits, and allows lots of flexibility in how you track; daily, weekly, 3 times per week, etc\u2026 I like that you can color code and order the habits. I order for morning til nighttime. You can also have habits disappear off your list once completed. Of all the apps I tried this has the best options for tracking habits you do a certain amount of times in a week, instead of just once a day. I can keep my exercise streak alive 6 days a week and not worry about taking Sundays off and losing my streak. This app should be used by a lot more people as it\u2019s better than so many of the other more expensive paid apps.",
