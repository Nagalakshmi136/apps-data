64df1388-089e-4cfa-880e-f44e6208f5f8,I have tried many time tracking devices. This is the Only one that has you track your last time as soon as you pick up your phone from screen saver. It's genius. That way you never forget. It's also very intuitive. I NEVER leave reviews just because I'm really busy and 99% of things to me do warrant my time. But this app is wonderful.

When i put in Studying, I can go into the Edit window and write about what I studied in that hour. It doesn't have to pop up everytime I log in an activity, that'll be annoying.

It gives you the option to be prompted after you unlock your phone with a log that can easily be dismissed. In it you can tell it what you were up to since the last time you were asked.

I tried to use time tracking apps before but got too frustrated having to open up the app, start and stop timers , etc. With this app you just tap the activity that you want to log AFTER the time period since you last checked your phone (there's a setting to change the minimum time intervals) so you don't have to think about what you are going to do next. It flows with your lifestyle. I'd at least give it a go!",5

Thank you so much for making such a productive app. I wish that a one time purchasing or atleast an year's subscription was as much as the monthly one.

Can't believe the stupid negative reviews about limiting features for free use, and ppl who r too dum to figure out how to change logged time.

14ff106a-0797-464b-941e-aecb0d971e30,"Absolutely fantastic and exactly what I was looking for! I wanted to start logging my time to better help with my health and mental state. To do that I needed an option that was simple and easy and the fact that the UI is so attractive drew me right in. I love that it will show up on my lock screen and I can add in time whenever I would like. I got the habit of plugging in what I've been doing as I finish within the first use. It's pleasing to see the time add up, and the reminder has already pulled me out of a few otherwise long Imgur sessions. I'm still new, but bought a subscription the second day. Something I RARELY do for apps. I can count my purchases on a single hand. It's so user-friendly, and tracking my time is already helping. I've been spending my fays more wisely when I see a visual log of what I do. I can't wait to see their new additions. Thanks for such a handy app, it's already improving my life and making me feel better. Keep up the hard work!",5

I like the way it reminds me periodically to think what I'm doing with my time and gives nice graphical history of how I've spent my time. And does it without me having to remember to check the app / log anything etc. It asks you regularly ""What did you do in the past X minutes"" . This is very good as the apps that require you to remember to input the data, you will start to ignore or forget. You can also manually add data for passed time ""E.g. you procrastinated for 15 mins and start working now. Open the app and log your procrastination time"" I strongly recommend anybody with productivity oriented mindset to try it.",5

642ea096-cce0-4933-b365-cd993a7b75ec,"The most useful time tracking app I have ever used and I've been using them since I was seventeen. I am twenty three now and this is one of the highest quality apps on the play store because of the flawless UX and UI. I hope I never accidentally delete it. I emailed the developer asking them not to change the app because it is so perfect. The UI is better than that of any app I have ever used. Ever. And I am a person that choses apps carefully, only keeps apps I use and I prefer to buy apps rather than having free apps because I believe in supporting the developer. I hope Google doesn't overlook this app as an app of the year in some category or something because if this app doesn't get an award, I may not care quite as much that one app has an award over another...that is probably false, but I really feel this app needs special recognition because this app makes having an android phone (or a phone at all) better than not having an android phone...doesn't that constitute grounds for recognition, Google? I would like to know your opinion on this. Being my favorite company and all, I care what you think and why...though if this app doesn't get it I may not agree with the decision....but why?",5

3b218f98-108d-4914-9204-795d5019c3f2,"just what I was looking for all these years! A few ideas for the developer, if you want to improve your app: 1. more than 3 categories would be good. like ""bad stuff"" (and a stop-sign icon) for when you catch yourself doing something you don't want to and shouldn't do. maybe even a list where users can rename the defaults and add our own categories! 2. can we get the options for columns and rows in settings, please? I have a big enough screen for 4x3 or 4x4 tiles. 3. I would also like it if I could join adjacent history items into one, when for example ""out with friends"" is followed by more ""out with friends"" every time I look at my phone. I'd rather see it as one item which is two hours long, instead of 8 15-minute items! replace the ""multiple"" button with a check box for ""join with previous if possible"" - we can tap-and-hold to record multiple activities. 4. could we get the option to freely choose time periods for statistics? like ""past 2 days (including today)"" or ""January 31st - February 4th"" 5. in edit history, I'd like to quickly go back to a specific date, instead of scrolling down the infinitely long list. maybe just have an option to see history items at the bottom of the statistics view. (see idea 4.) 6. why do we have to log in? what is it used for, what data are you collecting? 7. I wish I had found this app when searching for an activity log / quick activity logging / database / record, and lock screen (persistent notification / status bar pinned) life tracker. I'm a java developer who's getting into Android and I have a lot of free time. can I help in any way? looking forward to increasing my rating! many thanks! :-)",5

Easy to use - pops up on your lock screen at customized time intervals, you press a button to record what you're doing, and you're done. Would love the option to add additional tiles for more categories though. Bonus points for quick response time and customer service when I had problems with installation. Thank you!",5

d5dc7691-aa99-4328-b1ab-cc7e59e1418b,Have been using it for several weeks now and it is great. Very simple with limited options which I think is part of its beauty as it forces you to simplify the categories making tracking quick and easy. It also prevents me from overthinking and tracking throughout the day is effortless with the option to skip the prompt screen as needed. I love being able to review how my time is spent and the new option to correct a prior event. I see myself using this app for a long time. Thank you!,5

I would really like if we could split/specify time between activities since I might have done several tasks before checking my phone, and I'm not necessarily spending every minute of the day doing any of the activities I've specified. Being able to do this without naming one of the activities as ""unspecified"" would be great!

Yes you might lose some fine granularity on your data but you're pretty much guaranteed to get your entire day logged and that's invaluable.
