It's a bit tedious to set up activities, but I don't mind. I would like devs to fix the issue with clicking on categories directly transferring me to edit them unless clicked specifically on ""select"" text to the right of the screen. Also, some activities I don't do on a regular basis are still part of the regular list. I don't want them to be there",4

ef9c2c85-449a-4a36-b465-a8965566c76f,The app is really the best one as far as I have used it. The one thing is that only 6 activities can be added which is not enough. But the lifetime purchase pack for 1400rs is really a good offer if you are gonna use it regularly and also planning to buy that any time soon and 99per month.

98fd941b-a27f-4af2-a097-4ad7057cec36,I'm trying out your app and so far I'm satisfied with it. Only issue I have is while adding time in multiple activities we cannot specify the timing correctly in the app. Example : during 2pm to 4pm I watched Netflix and used social media. While adding time in these 2 activities simultaneously I cannot specify that during 2pm to 3pm I watched Netflix and during 3pm to 4pm I was on social media. I can definately add 1-1 hour's in both activities but your app just randomly decides the timing.,4

de611c7d-37cf-4bcb-81c8-b8c6b325235a,"This is still the ONLY android app to EASILY track your life 24/7 continuously. It does one thing and does it well - the lock-screen tracking is by far the most convenient way to track your time. Every other app you have to open it & manually start and end an activity and while that might be viable short-term or for a single project, this flow is too heavy for continuous uninterrupted tracking. I have used SaveMyTime for more than an year and have detailed, accurate info on all my activities for that time, it is great. I have taken a break from tracking, but recently started again since I realise how beneficial it is. I track my work, my workouts, the quality time i spend with my family and the time i procrastinate. The benefit for me comes not from seeing your time spent graph at the end of the day, but from the habit of selecting your activities through the day. Makes your more mindful and self accountable about how you spend your time while its happening not post factum. I've went through different challenges setting up my activities and my suggestion to others is to keep it simple - set up detailed activities for only the most important or problematic things in your life, keep everything else broad. I track a specific work project or the time i spend with my daughter, but most daily stuff like eating, chores etc. all go under a single general category that I don't really care for but is needed so everything else is accurately timed. As said the app works well for me, as far as I know the developers keep it up to date and it works without issues on all devices. No features are being added or improved however. It's quite bare bones on bonus features. The export feature is close to useless, it gives very raw data export and a lot of manual work would be needed to make sense of it. I've suggested adding the option for grouping activities on the tracking screen in a folder like structure to keep it more tidy if you have a bigger number of activities, but it was not implemented. Goals tab has no features, would be nice to at least be able to see your goals progress in a widget. A todo list styled feature like TickTick app geared more towards personal development rather than shopping lists would go with this app very well.",4

The line between needed/procrastination was sometimes blurry, since I ""need"" to meet my friends to keep in touch with them, but I don't need to go party with them every weekend. This helped me change how I spend my time by forcing me to actively acknowledge every time I decided to procrastinate. I had the app prompt me every time I unlocked the phone (5 min interval minimum), and I also manually used the notification icon if I was going between categories without unlocking my phone (this further ensured I acknowledged that now I was choosing to procrastinate). I only used the app for about 3 weeks, since it got a bit tedious, but I have managed to maintain the mind set of being actively aware of what I am spending my time on and being honest to myself regarding where that activity falls in the 3 categories I mentioned at the beginning.

For one, it uses a lot of battery. As in the most draining thing on my phone. The other issue is the pricing model. It runs on a monthly or annually recurring payment system. If this was 5 bucks I probably would have bought it. Instead it's $3.01 for the monthly or $21.54 a year which I think is too much just get more activities, custom colors and icons and the ability to export data.

As someone who multitasks a lot, not being able to enter multiple tasks for the same segment of time instead of splitting the time makes the recording process confusing at times.

The symbols and colours are a big part of that. The fact that you can enter multiple activities over a timespan is also very useful.

Because I have quite a few activities however, It would be super useful to be able to add and customise my own categories I.e. the work/life/other. My reports are quite ""colourful"" with all my activities and a bit too much to analyse. It would be great to see a quick personalised summary and then dig deeper if I wanted to i.e. have each of my businesses as a category with the associated activities. That would get a 5 stars from me.",4
89d4c81d-7a46-4302-97d1-c6b70fd48ad7,"This is a fresh concept that works surprisingly well. I installed this app at the same time that I installed several other time tracking apps. I actually zeroed in on this one and one other to start. While the other one is good, the reality is that I almost never remember to record my time in it. However with this app, I don't have to remember anything. I just unlock my phone and with one quick tap my time is recorded. On the one hand, at first it feels a little bit funny for the time to not be exactly precise. On the other hand, having a little bit chunky data is much much better than having no data at all. So for the other app I have recorded maybe three things in the last 5 days. For this app I have a wealth of data already. Nice to see that They just added the CSV download but I haven't tried it yet. The one thing I would like to see is a widget which takes me straight into the manual time selection screen in one click. That's the screen with the little timer on it in the home screen of the app. Building on that, it might be nice to have a widget where I can choose which activity icons to put onto my desktop for those times when I actually want to manually denote what I've been doing. One could rightfully ask if I will remember to do that. It's a good question. Sometimes I actually have been wanting to do this. So at least being able to get to the activity selection screen in one click would be nice. Another thing that would be nice is if the app could automatically characterize when I'm in a moving car. I guess the trick would be if it could do that without draining my battery. Anyhow any how the summary is that because of the automatic nature of the one click prompt to categorize what I've been doing, I'm actually getting data where previously I didn't. That's huge. Along those lines, it would be nice to be able to step back day by day and not just have yesterday and last week. So now with CSV I can do that myself which is a good backup. In terms of visualization of data, that could be a black hole of Feature work but my hunch is that there are going to be a small number of visualisations that most people use most of the time.",4

I totally forgot to track anything the last 107 hours because of this.. It has happened multiple times.

13805a4d-5641-4c06-a909-5e90ff143668,"Great idea to have it prompt you on the lock screen! I've tried other time tracker apps but would forget to log what I was doing. This solves that problem! There are a few things I'd like to see, though: 1) I wish the statistics would show you what times of the day you spend on your activities, not just the percentage of time spent. I would love to use this app to help me see exactly when and where I'm getting off track from my intended schedule. 2) More activities: I don't see why the icons couldn't be smaller to allow for more activities to choose from. 3) When assigning multiple activities to a duration of time, I'd like an option to assign all of the activities for the full time (multitasking) as opposed to splitting the time between the activities. Looking forward to further developments on this app!",4

be4df8bd-bf1b-4ff9-8cbe-5084792f10f8,"I love this app. Being able to track my time as it happens is great. However, this app has a bit of a security flaw. If you're on the lock screen where you select the category for how you spent your time, you can hold down the hold button, and get to the recent apps page. Pressing the home button again gets you to the home screen. You don't have to enter in your phone's password at all in order to do this.",4
3ccf2674-5274-4d31-aeed-206f9eb77963,"Is a very good app, and the idea of placing the boxes on the lock screen is very smart and efficient. Would be really nice to being able to see the past days in different chart/circles, Instead of merged all in one circle.",4
fb7cb94e-228e-4485-84dc-9b8d3e65d5bb,Nice concept. Good app! Would recommend to people who want to trace their time.,4
3c6d5eea-73e1-44de-a999-fc0e76aef5c2,"I like the idea that I can log my time activities and then analyse where do I waste time or how I can improve the time I spend to increase productivity. I like that I don't need to remember to open an app to add data, it asks me on preset intervals. What I don't like is that it is limited to 9 activities....Do you really have only 9 activities in your life? Please adjust that. Thank you.",4
505f75df-cab6-4936-a921-f1ecd687c493,"I just need to have a choice to delete some time and control other time better. I don't want to count time when I sleep or work. I do it every day, and I don't want to tell the app, that I'm at work every day. But for my free time that app is the best. So please make it possible to control only time that I want to control. Like 8 hours per day for example. But with the same we'll and month statistic. Update: Changed to 5 stars after reply ;)",4
