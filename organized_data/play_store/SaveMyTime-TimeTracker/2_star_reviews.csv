6f27e7dd-3b5d-4d56-b182-15c8515ccb2f,Too difficult to setup,2
d7d75bf5-816d-42a0-860a-63dbf695a39c,I don't understand the app. When I try to make my OWN schedule it automatically does it on its own. I can't seem to adjust my own time saving. I'll need this app on here for a day but after that :litter_in_bin_sign:.,2
ed179a40-80db-41f1-8c91-350d7e5352fc,asks too much to open,2

66e160a4-c4fc-4c44-968d-3f0a6114743c,"This app is a go-to time management solution with zero distraction, minimalist design, and visual graph of how you used your time today, this week, this month, or even this year. Things like Netflix binge takes 2 hours out of the day, not much, but after 365 days, you've wasted a month on Netflix. :exploding_head: On top of that, no ads. What's more to ask for, other than waiting for it on iOS :grinning_face_with_sweat:",2
092013d3-3859-4e72-88cc-32742ebcdfea,I purchased a lifetime subscription to the app but am unable to access it. Have reached out to developed via the app and have not heard back. Great app otherwise but wouldn't recommend purchasing.,2
af9e3777-54de-47d8-9256-3dae54100604,Agree with prev. reviews. Was looking forward to seeing previous statistics of my time spent and the free version is too restrictive even for the year. Premium is far too expensive compared to alternatives too.,2
c3935717-9e72-43e7-9735-0ee3f692ab4e,It's really helpful if you're aiming for a big goal... It reminds you of your time stats like how much of your time have been wasted and was consumed at right place.. Was never aware of such informative app. Will continue to use this. Sincere thnks to this app I'm able to save my time.,2
560999b8-e4d4-40e9-983e-0e401e08ccbf,I have changed my rating to 2 star because your app have only one widget for use. You should have focus on widget kind of things as it is more usable feature. Please add some widget related to how many hours left or how much time I have used on what. Other wise app and UI is good.,2
5db55c14-7005-4980-98ba-459d8803fe17,"Although the app seems to work, I don't like the lack of UX. Nonsensical default values (like checking what I did last couple minutes instead of seeing my lockscreen to check the notification; checking that every 0 minutes...), bad integration (interferes with the lock screen). Cannot add the preset activity later on, necessary to create new activities. The check screen always in fullscreen, even if doesn't follows the lockscreen. Nonnegligible background memory use (50 MB).",2
902eede8-18e8-4bc6-ba7a-a5eaa8547b82,I paid for theifetime version however the app has not updated and the e.ails to the developer remoan unanswered since last 2 days Really liked the app hence subscribed in 2 days but very disappointed and confused if this is genuine or technical issue,2
54acbcbf-7a9a-4772-9595-c230900ece6a,Whenever I use phone for study or other activities the app comes over the screen frequently and distract me from whatever I'm doing. It's very annoying.,2
e961b777-9827-457f-90ba-6e344da07233,The app is not able to track time. It doesn't pop up everytime. It missed the tracking. I have used it two years back. It was best. But now it is worst using and be dependent on this app. I have emailed them too many times but their response is too late and issue is not yet solved. The problem is that the app works well for few times when you actually enter the app and then it doesn't pop up on ur screen and mislead you regarding time management and time tracking.,2
a8c12947-8dfa-44f3-af2b-0cd625e69686,App is really too good,2
173ddc84-6173-40c1-97b9-87be71946ca6,"Good app, but now unable to login to my account, with no option given other than Facebook login, which doesn't work. No reply from the support email either, so unfortunately going to cancel my subscription :disappointed_face: Edit: Developer got back to me and resolved the issue :thumbs_up_medium_skin_tone:",2
b9d2f3cc-5490-474c-bde3-76e78d50ab29,"I love the idea of this app, but it's ridiculous that you can't add any tracking catagories unless you get an expensive subscription. Even if you change the existing catagories, there's still not enough of them to actually track your day in any meaningful way.",2

59eb1111-c897-43d2-8b4d-ebd2574ac636,Loving the app and I had paid money for life and it is not upgraded :face_with_rolling_eyes:.And there is no reply from their end. Hoping a reply from them atleast now!!,2
c6d2eb38-99d5-4045-afc0-11dfb24dd044,"Great concept and design, but it's not a free app. What you download is a heavily restricted trial version. Max of 9 loggable activities unless you buy a subscription. Does not allow multitasking.",2
8db1eaef-0a13-4abc-97ba-e2fb0c05266b,"I really loved this app, like finally, an application which makes tracking time, both easy and effective. But as I also read in another comment, the time noted for start of any activity is often wrong. It is so frustrating that this app is just what I wanted but due to the small problem, I couldn't possibly use it. Developers please look into it. My device is realme 3, Android 10. I'll be happy to share more info if you guys can fix it somehow. Thankyou",2
90854d03-68f0-48eb-806e-0487264c49e8,The name af the app is save my time but it should actually be named as track my time U actually shows where your time is being spent but it doesn't gives you any. Particular solution to save the time. It's like giving you data and leaving the analysis upon you.,2
4a4e3b0a-2a01-4aa8-b5f7-6e206f7a7559,For the first few weeks it works properly but after that it cannot track properly...... Almost forget to ask after every unlock.....,2
96f15f29-8d9f-4bf9-9a0e-16a83a2a2483,"Overall disappointed with billing customer service. I stopped using this app after switching to an iPhone. I later saw on my credit card statement that another year had been billed (automatically), but SaveMyTime refused to refund even though I hadn't used the app for the last few months and they had billed a year in advance.",2

c82a1bba-0279-4faa-b84d-081e891b3114,"A fun little project for a few weeks until you realize that 9 is absolutely not enough slots for activities. I ended up having to prioritize my work activities and the bad habits I wanted to keep track of instead of the activities I spend most of my time doing to accurately portray my day. Couple that with the annoying bug that makes the app open up every 45 second to one minute when you're clearly doing something else (ex. reading an online article or playing a game), and its just too annoying.",2
ebc15900-2523-45da-ba5d-802a11549739,I can't add widget to my home screen although my touch screen is perfectly wrking. Disappointed,2

b8b6eb14-b1ff-4ec5-b2d4-683da2f1c5ac,Not sure why you need my social pedica profile at first step .. not fine.. uninstalling,2
8bc603e4-4dff-429f-adda-a2c6888066e4,"This app would be perfect if it weren't missing a crucial feature. SaveMyTime is exactly what I was looking for to track how much time I spend on different projects at work. However, the lack of ability to edit time entries or add entries manually renders the app ineffective. I want to start my tracking at 8:30am, but when I select an activity, it lists it as having lasted for the previous 13 hours, with no way to edit the time. If I delete the entry, it just asks about the last 13 hours again.",2
39d2048d-a4d1-4f62-8e29-564d4f834433,Most off the features are premium,2
23118861-ff1a-4008-962d-15b8c93cc1b5,"Only 9 different activities allowed ! It's just too little to be used properly , so without paying it's unusable , unfortunately. What about pre-set activities for free, and custom ones as premium feature , at least?",2
de899329-df3f-47d0-8209-0a27381fee68,crashes when i try to create account using email. Other options appear to progress if i select then. I don't want Google or FB linked so I'll have to delete,2
4dc9026f-3d89-4372-a7ce-bce3ee97cb43,It doesn't allow me to log in. Always keep saying of some unexpected error. Also the app doesn't show any activity to choose from lock screen as it doesn't display activity list.,2
788faccf-4aa8-4103-955c-24ec6de76844,In resent update was added that app is popping up when I use other apps. It's very uncomfortable specially when I watch something or process some payment. Why this feature is not possible to disable in settings?,2

7141352a-5424-477c-9d4c-56ffd0279000,"Been using this for about 6 months. Other trackers expect you to remember to switch tasks which never works, but asking when unlocking your phone works well. Sadly lacking when it comes to the actual analysis; the statistics screens are very limited, and no way to change the cutoff of a day from midnight to something like 3am, for those who work late. Finally, pro pricing is unreasonable, asking for a subscription fee just to allow me access to my own historical data, stored on my own phone! Edit: Thanks for the generic response that shows you haven't actually read my review.",2
d058ae35-c151-4354-9f1c-52aab3be5427,"Decent app, but the number of activities/categories you can track is locked behind a paywall. You can choose between a monthly/yearly subscription or a one-time payment of $99, none of which are worth it just to track more things. Overall 2 stars for anti-consumer price gauging. There is currently a free app with exactly the same functionality which lets you track unlimited categories and activities; i'd recommend looking for that instead if you don't care about the cloud services offered here",2

a1642e4c-45b7-4358-928d-5cc212e187b7,"I would be willing to subscribe, but the app has one major flaw. When I go to enter an activity, I can change the duration, but not the start or end times. It makes it very frustrating for entering in activities. I will continue to try to use it for a few days, but considering how frustrating it is to enter activities, I probably will delete it.",2

33fe48cc-1208-442c-85fe-840a47226e86,"The app seems good, but the free features are very limited, you can only add 9 types of activities and afterwards it asks you to pay a monthly subscription. What's the point of a free version that doesn't let you track your whole day, just parts of it? It's kinda useless. I feel like a subscription would be more appropriate for other kind of features.",2
fa8318a3-8f95-40c3-a2e9-a7eb52cce106,Far too inflexible. Must have at least 6 amd noore than 9 things to track and theyust be their predefined ones. This didn't match my intentions. Oh well. I love the idea. I just dont kniw why so strick with following their ideas. Kinda weird.,2
fbf50e37-14f0-4d5e-b946-8710904b0425,New version not useful for those who just want to know how much time they spent on specific activities. it doesn't show graph whenever we want to see in whole day. it irritates now.,2
2d1c64b7-ea2f-45de-a44b-6db429f35c88,The activity selector on lock screen is VERY GOOD. first problem: Unfortunately you can't insert manual activity.

fa8d0d9d-2c66-43ad-8ceb-da2be12a1650,"9x9 tiling was looking better in the free version, and you'd to remove it in the latest update giving only 16x16. Is this to promote the paid version of the app?",2
a311ea7d-b4d3-461d-8896-9972c3c907c2,"It is unfortunate to have what may seem like a great app fail to have a proper support in place.

I need sometimes that syncs with Google calendar, I would appreciate some recommendations. Thank you",2
84557bce-6975-4970-9a83-56d38f06ef59,"Let me start off with the positives, the time tracking screen appearing after the phone unlock screen is absolutely brilliant. However, the app falls short in the data it exports. Particularly with regards to the format. Activities that start in one day and continue onto the next aren't apportioned per day and reformatting the data takes forever. (especially, since all time is expressed in millisecond)",2

a9590546-2c66-46e7-b29d-001b17d93063,"Decent, simple app. UX could be improved slightly, navigation through menus and editing history isn't the best. Also would be nice to have the ability to ignore sleep when looking at statistics.

Edit2: been using this for a few months now and want to look at my history past a month - but I can't until I pay for a subscription? The pro app is not worth a monthly fee, maybe a one time fee of $7. If I can't analyse my time spent over a larger period of time than a month then this app is practically useless. It was already frustrating enough only being able to choose from 9 tasks. 2 stars until the pro features become more accessible.",2

73e8ae19-9055-423c-99f4-d26419367659,Great app other then this annoying bug. After your selected time goes off sometimes it will turn on my phone and make me choose before I have to unlock my phone and won't turn off until an activity is selected. And sometimes when I turn my phone all the options show up to instead of showing up after I unlocked my phone. Sometimes it will be normal though.,2

I've already emailed the creator about additional features that I want to see and will be beneficial for everybody. That is to add specific date viewer and other types of statistics. Like other users I am quite disappointed about the pricing. I want to clear things out first. This program you are selling, I believe, you dont need to work on it for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week perpetually right? That after youve made some specific change for about, let's say, 1 month, you dont need to work on it for 5 days a week for 8 hours right straight again, forever? But if we pay a yearly subscription of ~ $20 ($1.67/month). And lets say only 1% (of 100 thousand) of your total users (1000 users) paid for the premium. You are getting $20, 000 for something you dont work for 8 hours a day 5 days a week, EVERY YEAR, PERPETUALLY. Thats only 1% of all the user. I dont think that is fair that you ask us to pay you PERPETUALLY buy you will not work on this project PERPETUALLY. That is why we users are very very disappointed.",2

A bit confusing as to how exactly the logging works, and I notice weird results where an activity will be overrepresented.",2

c1f8476e-9626-470f-9fd6-8419dc8941ec,"Besides what some users already mentioned about limit of amount of activities, I'd like to see more icons. For now the set of them is very poor for me. Also it could be handy to be able to add categories other than preset ""Work"", ""Life"", and ""Other"". And about big problem: app eats 100MB of RAM on the start of the system! I could think it's somehow inevitable, but when I used my phone for about a week without shutting it down or rebooting the number hit 345MB and lockscreen was very slow!!! This should be optimised.",2

b67da5b7-a34d-4462-99f7-d8cb8da92c63,Giving it two stars only because i love the idea of this app. Whenever I have to type in something the whole screen is black. I'm left to guess what the app wants me to do. I can't even see what I'm blindly typing. Would be cool if it could be fixed.,2
4ff1a3b7-272f-418b-92db-2a960282df0a,I have tried many time management apps...including paid versions...but this one requires less discipline and much kore real time tracking of activities.. that too free of cost.,2

I look at my phone often so I set the interval to 10 minutes but sometimes you do random things like walk somewhere or clean something or answer a random call etc. So I skipped the answer but the time continued to add so it came to the question what I was doing for the past 5 hours. Which was just plenty of random activities, including also the listed ones like reading but not for several hours. And I would prefer setting the active time, not 24 hours.",2
5b71eaa4-0edc-4b30-933a-481b7eac8966,"Jumping from task to task is difficult to record on here. And if you work for an hour but spent 10 min on a personal phone call all without touching your phone, you can't split that time up- you'll have to pick work or personal call. There is no way to edit past activities, but I see that in October they said they would out out another version that would allow this. Hopefully that happens sooner rather than later. Until then I'll check around a few other apps, but I hope this one updates soon.",2

63736f8b-7244-49e0-aff2-0fe82e1a7bda,Did not ask consistently enough. Being asked what I did for the last 18hrs really defeats the purpose.,2
