b09f147d-6366-4416-9d97-2fb568fcc16f,"Best, cross platform Habits app in my humble opinion. Available on android, IOS and through a web portal. Killer feature for me, you can set multiple reminders to complete each individual task- more than once a day, which is surprisingly rare in habit software. It also has a lifetime licence which is great if you like me, can't always justify to yourself spending monthly on every good app you use. I had problems with notifications but that was resolved by changing my Android settings and was nothing to do with Habitify. The Support Team were patient and helpful, responding remarkably quickly considering they are in a different time zone. I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to give this app a try. It has changed my life and I am so much more productive as a result.",5
