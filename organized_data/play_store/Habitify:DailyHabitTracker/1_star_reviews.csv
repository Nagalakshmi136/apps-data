Sometimes when I launch the app it just doesn't load habits, sometimes when I try to complete/undo it doesn't or might just delete the habit, and if I mark habits as complete on one day it will mark them as failed the next day. I am on a Google Pixel 7. Such a shame, I was much prepared to pay and use this app. If you can fix the app and confirm that you have fixed it, I will happily return.",1

Support stopped responding to my polite inquiries and now I paied 50€ for something I dont use and they did not respond to this day to several of my emails and your story will probably be the same. This tracker is basic at best and it has problems even with the basic tracking (mentioned later). ----I found the goal system doesn't work at all. For example when I select Limit caffeine and I put a cap/goal of 1mg, then if i exceed the limit it counts as a completed task/habit and makes a streak which does not correspond with the premade template of ""Limit Sugar"" or ""Limit Caffeine"". Both of them do not make sense as they are implemented right now.The only good thing about this app is a multiplatform sync and that’s all. If you pay them, you are out of luck :) The way their payment system and Terms of Service are set up, it allows them NOT TO HONOR 95% of the refunds and simply say, you are out of luck. I read previous reviews and found reoccurring issues + the support stopped responding after I requested a refund. -----Another user asked them for a refund and they stalled and then basically denied the request. I asked for a refund the very same day (I bought the app) and they told me they cannot do anything (so I contacted Google support and they told me they CAN and they SHOULD) Earlier the support was responsive but after the request they simple started to ignore me, very good way to treat a customer. ----When I want to create my own habits, it only let you specify how many times (not how many minutes, miligrams, …), you have to pick the template for that and even that does not work as intended. Meditation template on the mobile provides you with different options than the meditation template through a web based UI. I could go on, but this dev doesn’t even deserve more than this review!!",1
