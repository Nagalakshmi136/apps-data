595b57e5-3a44-4b72-91f3-ac7773cad907,It is very frustrating. I am being limited from using it at all due to having to pay for premium? You might as well have charged from the beginning as I need to pay to continuing keeping track of my progress after the third or so date of tracking. I was very taken by this app before but that problem is too big for me to continue using as there is no free version for this . Not to mention I put some steps with my routines and after the second day they disappeared.,2

They can have units, but you can't add progress to then from your journal, instead you have to go through two menus to a buggy dialog.

Unfortunately, I think I will uninstall it and move to something else. Notifications, the feature which is the most improtant to me does not work well. If multiple notifications are present in the android notification screen, you can only do an action on the first from the top. Clicking on others actually triggers an action on the first notification which to me, a software developer, seems like a pretty feasible fix. I reported the bug on the forum a month ago and first got a vague response from the developers. Now, after I've nudged them after some time of inactivity on that bug report I was given an answer it would be fixed in a week or two as their Android developer is busy making another app. To me, this does not seem fair as this software has paying users like me. Active maintenance of the software should be a must if you want this app to grow to its full potential. Apart from wrong mapping of the notifications, I realized a few days ago that the reminders aren't even triggering anymore or they trigger a few hours late. Like I've read on the other reviews, streaks have weird algorithm which or are just broken because if I skip a habit the streak will not break. Maybe this is a feature and not a bug, but it may be stated more clearly that this functionality is present. Aside from some broken functionality, this app has an intuitive and simple design which works very well for a habit tracking app. The statistics are meaningful and can provide a nice feedback for your performance (I am now only a bit concerned on the accuarcy, but in theory the reports are very well thought out).
