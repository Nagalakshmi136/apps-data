Like if I have stretching for only Monday, Wednesday and Friday and I do an extra session on Tuesday it is possible to check that off but it's not super easy to do that and you have to dig a bit to access. Especially if you do more habits + design is nice, I like that you can add notes with photos too and stats",3

It does register the taps, and you only see that you have tapped it too often after changing what habits to show, because it only refreshes then.

345e3121-d355-4d53-b260-287f51609afa,I have an interface related request to the team and please take it seriously: -The mood log is really furstrating when logging it for a previous day. when you go to a certain date and add a mood log only to realise later that it was added for today's date instead.

7397d861-df54-498e-b6c4-0a1ffa040505,Good but missing essential feature.

d6030c79-6a4e-4a64-bd85-b6ce16bf7810,Yeah okay I'm sorry but locking completing a daily habit behind a paywall is basic functionality.

The app has sufficed for my preferences -- I was looking for an app with a simple, minimal, clutter-free, but functional UI.

I have an exercise log on my Garmin and I thought I would put that data on habitify too so that I can track my good habits in one place but trying to do that has me totally beaten. It shouldn't be difficult but to me it seems it is. I now wish I had never paid the Â£20 or so as I won't be using this app now.,3

c109fbb2-e0ea-40c2-bf7a-986d4d51cf27,"Pretty good habit tracker with a nice UI. Free version is terrible and only lets you have 3 habits. Has a few bugs with the biggest being the account system not even working. Both the sign up and sign in buttons take you to a blank page. And whatever you do - don't press the sign out button. Still, I liked it enough to get the lifetime - or planned to, anyways. There's no way to change your subscription plan from the app. Unfortunately, I pressed the sign out button. All my habits? Gone. The 1-month premium? Gone. Thankfully, the month I bought was almost up. The time I spent using it was worth it, but I'm sure as hell not paying for a second.",3
3ffbcab1-ac2f-4442-8a81-b48e17470fa1,"Good: Clean UI, very fluid use, tons of stats. Bad: Free version limit of 3 habits and even dark mode is locked. You need premium or this app is just not worth it.",3

2fb34be0-15e4-4de3-9d4e-47fe55f88474,"The UI differs a little from screenshots on Play's page. It's not bad however. Functionality is good too. The app requires an account, which is why it's bad, cause maybe I just want to test it and try some things, but I can't do that so easily. App makes you pay for dark mode and I find it so disturbing. It's OK to monetize some of your functionality but it's not it, it's just a theme which can be used in any other app for free.",3
7e95ecc0-7924-4549-96e7-a63a113eecb9,it has beautiful UI but unfortunately you have to go premium to add more than 3 habits,3

e900409d-402a-41b7-944e-19866c941ee0,It is good to track habits. But a feature for quitting bad habits is needed. I request developers to please add the feature to quit bad habits. Please,3

7e1e8a63-40eb-4e6d-ada6-af5943df80ec,You can't do much with this app unless you go Premium. They have a cap that prevents you from having more than 3 habits. I don't see the point of it having a free version in the first place.,3
58cc57a4-124f-4fe5-9705-20806decf376,"Can you please give option to make the widget dark theme? It sticks out bad on a phone where everything is dark mode enabled. I see that dark mode is being offered as a paid feature, at least implement it fully for the price you are asking, possible make it nicer or add options to customize it while you are at it? Apart from that it's a great app.",3

4c5f0210-7719-491d-98c6-e85e5458ae60,I like the interface but the web and mobile don't sync correctly or immediately. Also it keeps telling me I didn't complete something last time when I did which is disheartening and not what someone needs to create habits. The UI is great though,3

How am I supposed to get a feel for if the app works for me if I can only track 3 things a day? The popup asking for money felt rude. I'd barely started using the app and already I'd done all I could do. There should be at least 10 free habits.",3
