I want to read 3 times a week, sometimes it'll be Mon/Tues/Wed, but it might be Mon/Thurs/Fri. I want the habit to appear for today, I click complete, and it appears the nexy day. I need flexibility. And Habitbull does this, so does Habitnow. Habitify should download those apps and copy the mechanics of this feature. It is used in maybe every other habit. If this were fixed, 5 stars",4

Pros- * Interactive and attractive UI. * Dashboard to track overall progress of all habits. * Good in-app suggestions for common habit building. * Integrated with the cloud to give seamless experience Cons- * UI is not snappy or very quick.

The timer needs to be more accurate and flexible and record any time recorded. The logged time doesn't show the start and end time and doesn't allow to change it, it allows to delete it only.
