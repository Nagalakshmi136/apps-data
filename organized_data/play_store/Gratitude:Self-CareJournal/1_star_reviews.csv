It told me free trial is not possible so I signed up for a monthly charge instead. There is no other way to transfer your entries to a new phone without membership (also seems unfair). Little did i know they had automatically subscribed me to the annual membership without any confirmation. Google doesn't refund. Developer doesn't respond",1

cbc32409-5b9c-447f-a68c-4589ee25403f,"I was actually very impressed with this app and the simplicity of using it. I had quite a few journal entries and then the other day, for no apparent reason, the app disappeared from my phone. It was the only app that did. I contacted owner of app to see how to recover all my journal entries but I never received a response... disappointing. Very upset that I lost all my personal journal entries. I don't trust this app that this might happen again to me.",1
