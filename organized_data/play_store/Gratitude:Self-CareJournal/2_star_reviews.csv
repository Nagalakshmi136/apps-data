be7a81c0-2f93-4825-acf3-acb9428b20ef,Has 4 sections. A journel section that you obviously populate or it's blank. An affirmations section with only one choice of 10 different affirmations unless you pay. A vision board section that basically lets you put a few photos and label it whatever you want. Lastly a daily zen section that shows you a daily quote. When you log the first time it traps you in a free trial screen where it's designed to make you think you either need to pay right now or sign up for a free trial to use it. Shady.,2

f080184a-5eee-4fb5-bb14-5536a9dc6517,I find the journal of gratitude mist rewarding to my day of positivity.,2
34e28fa4-abaf-458e-ae45-25c27d1e4821,"On the 2nd day of using i tried to write my affirmation and it will not allow me too. I shut off my phone, i tried to upload a pic. Nothing that part is frozen. VERY VERY frustrating. The journal part is great. Itherwise inlike the app but will be deleting soon if i cant write the affirmations.",2
1c329685-c47e-4815-8abb-1ce0e7f78c0d,A big issue I've been having with this app is not getting daily reminders. I stopped receiving them a while ago & the result was me falling off my daily gratitude journaling process which really sucks. It used to remind me and it suddenly stopped. The other day I tested out a new reminder time for 3 mins after I was setting it & it worked. It hasn't worked since. Trying not to delete this app but I'm getting close to it. I've highly recommended the app in the past but don't feel like I can again,2
31bd33ed-ac6f-4ae9-8c96-59aa6d126e21,It's a lovely concept but the app itself has a bug that causes all my apps to freeze and my phone goes crazy. I'm uninstalling it. Fix it. Please!,2
fd2e74e0-15d2-4f46-ae39-88cc3a9a7681,I didn't get affirmations. I thought affirmations would be given. Not that I would have to come up with them.,2
a57192e6-86e2-4d43-a6a9-26e597c4136e,Reminders stop after a while if im not regularly checking in on the app,2

872cb1e1-74ec-4398-8056-d1bf1068b8b6,My app keeps crushing. Even after i uninstalled and reinstalled it. I would like to have it working,2
9b5d5245-b30c-4344-9eb3-4f8c92caa434,I think this could be an awesome app and was excited to install it and get started. I wanted to use my fingerprint so I could make sure my enteries were private. I found where I could set up a passcode but not the fingerprint. when I tried to go back to my passcode it cut half the numbers off so now I'm locked out. cool idea but like others said you only get halfscreen.,2
33861976-53ca-4edb-bc68-dbefe0e1a5bb,"Was working great in the beginning, then there was an update and I don't get the notifications or they disappear. I stopped getting quotes in the morning and reminders to do my gratitude, so I had to change the time, which worked but then went away the next morning.",2
2466e07f-2eb2-4794-8df2-7d8e3778ca85,"good, easy to use app However, very disappointing that it is so difficult to transfer over to a new device. my old phone crappes out and because I didn't have it ""backed up"" to my google account (which I didn't know you needed to do), i jave LOST ALL my previous entries, a few months worth. I'm very disappointed about this as it is nice to be able to look back.",2

512e8489-5c25-460d-9055-f6d982eb553e,I just discovered this app mid of January and I would really want to write something on the previous dates specifically on the start of the new year but I can't seem to do it. Please show me how.,2
c23b462e-52fd-475d-a52f-6c22296db513,"Useally do not like these tye journals. I prefer the old school way. I'm not giving up handwriting but i think i will be keeping thid gratitude journal. Guess in my weird way, I'm saying I like it. Blessed be. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:",2
78df20ab-7125-4721-b856-b85ea90232a4,"A BUMMER: i used it once. it only showed the very first entry. Just a couple lines. Then the next day, I tried to make another entry. I can't get to the next day. it keeps sending me back to yesterday. controls are not intuitively obvious. it's a nice idea, but doesn't offer you titles or Geez much of anything - just a box to type in. Did not try to find something through search since I only had one day's worth with five entries. But I don't know how i would, can't see anything...",2

93e9253b-4889-4404-a5eb-54db9a563c2d,"Only using it a few days so far, BUT... :cross_mark::cross_mark::cross_mark:seems only way to back it up is to Goog Drive. No way on Earth I'm going to provide access to Drive to ANYONE, ESP total unknown app with tiny user group . Only other option w/o providing password to my other places (dropbox,etc) I is copy & paste (to word or email, etc). Hope I'm wrong, but this is a big issue to me. 2. Don't see a convenient way to format txt, i.e., bold, italics,font color, highlight,size 3. Would be nice to be able to have user-created categories , so could also sort on them, not only date. Examples= financial, health, relationships, career, emotions, hair transplants, Ingrown toenail recovery, pet, etc. Then, for example, one could view a whole series of just health gratitude, to put things in perspective when down w flu, etc.",2
