4d8ec720-e1eb-4f8e-ba9e-508407863998,This app is nice for journaling. You can write anything anywhere on your phone. As a person who doesn't want to waste money on buying books and pens this app was very useful. But there are times when I write a whole para and when I complete it. It disappears out of nowhere even when I save it. And when I leave and come back to continue it doesn't save the continued para.Because of this issue I'm giving it a 4 star. Please take this into consideration and fix it immediately.,4

It's entirely inefficient - since it doesn't take you directly to the photos app on your phone, you end up having to scroll and scroll and scroll if you want to add a photo that's older (or even sometimes if it's recent b/c they don't actually show up in reverse chronological order!).",4

I'm wondering, is there a way to transfer the content to be printed somehow? I would love to be able to compile this in a journal.",4
d26477fc-e6cd-456d-b6ca-7dff8d38ef2f,I really like this app. It is simple to use and I like how you can include a photo if you want. A suggestion I would have would be to be able to set multiple reminders. Right now you can only set one.,4

There should be a system to store the written data in case there is a problem with the phone so that the previously written data can be recovered.,4
