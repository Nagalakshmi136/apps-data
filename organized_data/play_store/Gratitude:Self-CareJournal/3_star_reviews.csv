5ce6d254-fcf1-4830-b4a1-d74b427f9870,I'd like it if it was a continuous set of questions. like a therapist or a manager which reminds you of your last thoughts and with questions helps you form new ones. other than that I like it.,3

For me it's redundant and I lost interest the second I paid the $40. I do enjoy the vision board but everything else is readily available in a multitude of other apps that serve my needs better. I really don't need an alarm to bug to write something It's big on streaks which mean nothing to me. I'm about authenticity and quality not mindless chatter,3
685682bc-a7d2-4c15-896f-41111a6280b7,ok I love the free part of this app but I think more needs to be free.
