Turns out to be a very good app with timely reminders to be grateful to all small things as well as bigger things on your life. Nice little app and I can certainly notice a difference of you honestly put efforts and want to get into a habit of being grateful for all small things that you take for granted otherwise. Strongly recommend the app to anyone even who don't know about gratitude and law of attraction!!!,5

5a33f37a-834f-403e-bea4-ab4a17d9f4cb,Gratitude journal is a perfect way to reflect upon one's life allowing them to take negative energy and turn it into positive energy. It helps to look back and see the gratitude not only that you have in life but that of other's through kind jesters that they partake onto you and other's. Often times people are focused on the negative and what they DON'T have. This app helps to remind you just how bleesed you truly are and to have great gratitude and happiness for what you DO have.,5

There's many things I love about it, such as: the meaningful daily affirmations that come out. being able to share them with special people. the banner of affirmations I can make for myself. I enjoy adding to them as I realize something meaningful about myself and then looking at them later and remembering these things about myself, which I sometimes forget almost as soon as I write them down. Simple yet meaningful qualities, like I am humble. the colors I can choose to reflect my post. being gently and unobtrusively reminded to make daily entries of gratitude. how I can use it as a journal. I LOVE that there are no ads! Most of all I am really grateful for the purity and simplicity of this app. This is one of the few apps I use regularly.

I have countless empty journals which I've collected over the years. I've only been using it for 3 days but the point is that I've used it every day since I stalled it. It's pretty cool that you can set reminders to remember your commitment to yourself. If you've had a hard time committing to journaling your gratitude then I highly recommend this app. PS...I am not techy or a phone person (meaning I only use my phone for basic things) and I have always thought that apps are dumb, so it's saying something that I'm using and reviewing it.",5
