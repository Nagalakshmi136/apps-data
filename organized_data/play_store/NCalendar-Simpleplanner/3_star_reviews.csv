97974904-88a9-4344-9f63-293ec8e7a7d3,Seems very cute but hard to make the shift. Is there anyway to import calendar dates from my other accounts? I have things planned months in advance so without being able to export / import these I'd have to enter everything in one at a time. What is the best way to start using this app?,3

dbf8e3d6-7b9e-44e9-8810-40ae65fc3203,"Just installed the app, first thing I noticed is that the date is not shown on the app. I have to open the app to see the date. First calendar I have seen that doesn't show the date. I will use it for a while to see if it's worth keeping.",3
4d747572-972a-4a5d-a057-f4f1db13a0fd,"I like the design alot, it is simple and easy to use. However the widget is broken and wont show the correct date, usualy a day or two behind witch makes it unusable.",3

4e12e189-203c-4a42-acf0-bf7518bd8029,Looks great. The events looked great in the setup....but....I can't figure out where to add my calendars that I saw in the setup window haha.,3
0dc63124-8f6c-44d3-9fc9-add5b2e88ba8,"Average. Should be able to click straight through to the day you tap on the widget, not just open the app. Also needs to be able to put a title on appointments. I'm more interested in the title than the place or URL or colour. This should display on the monthly widget. Also needs to be able to change the date format from MMDDYYYY to DDMMYYYY and display name of month in the calendar",3

ce1c8205-3452-48d8-8869-dec5ec8af0b9,귀찮아서 잘 안 쓰긴 하는데 지금까지 써본 캘린더 앱 중에 제일 괜찮은 듯. 기능도 미니멀하고 디자인이 전체적으로 심플한데 있을 건 다 있고.,3

d93c2002-15ad-4c41-b51c-52d9ea7b8e9e,Themes are so pretty. I like the app but there is no alarm or notification for events . is this problem only happened to me ?,3
55b21ade-b1b0-41d0-8493-0cc37681f0dc,please show the date of event for the notification. can't tell which plan is coming when they so close to each other,3
6d47e479-fd92-407d-afac-c2f9dfef6193,"No ads, looks cute, works well for organizing, notifications work, but it glitches whenever I try to perform an action. I wish that I could have kept using it, but it takes more time to manage time than it would take to actually be productive.",3
30d1e42c-16af-4221-bdea-573b72ce8d99,"hi so uh, I downloaded this app to keep my doctors and therapy appointments seperately so I can keep track of them more easily and I would really love and appreciate if there's a feature where I could set a specific amount of time for how many minutes, hours, days, and weeks ahead I would like the app to remind me (like Google calendar). I need to have an option to be able to set a reminder to at least a week (or preferably 9 days) ahead so I can notify my manager and ask for that day off.",3
