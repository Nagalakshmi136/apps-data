6409db62-d024-4ee5-9c0e-405284147631,"Love that this app is simple, easy to use and doesn't need to integrate with other calendars. We tried 4 before we found this one, none of them worked properly or they insisted on integrating with another calendar. Now my daughter can have her events on her calendar. Her events aren't filling up my calendar and she can't see what is on my Google calendar. Thank you!! Two thumbs up and Five stars!!!! :star-struck:",5

ea7037d2-ee82-4e16-ac04-2779394ddfd9,I never know what day it is so I needed a nice looking widget for my home screen to remind me everytime I unlock my phone. I don't like the google or outlook ones because I feel they unnecessarily complicate things so this gem of an app is my saviour. It's so pretty and I love the functionality and most of all the lack of account making. I will tell anyone who will listen about how long ive been searching for exactly this! Love it and thank you :pink_heart:,5

If someone were to need a simple calendar application this would be highly recommended.

6204184e-1f24-4bb8-acf1-26ec5fd7cc16,I love this app! It's very cute and keeps me organized. I have just a regular calendar book and I always forget to jot things in it. So this app is very helpful. When I want to clean a part of the house I'll jot it down on a day and time I want to try and clean. And it will remind me. And If I'm busy at that moment I will move the time down a little or move it to the next day. And I have put a widget on my screen so I don't forget to jot stuff in it. So I see it on my phone every day.,5
