1e9c6c18-b809-4db5-b294-9f05f7e7590c,"Note of improvement: 1) Multi check: let's say I need to create a schedule for every first and second Monday of the month. In the menu I can only choose the first Monday, and make another input for the same task for the second Monday. Seem redundant if I can just check both the 'first' and 'second' option at once. 2) option to create and delete all past similar events not just the future. And to ease the server load, just have viewable schedule up to 6 months prior or extra paid storage.",4
71c975f8-c46a-4f87-9389-1540cfb2c00c,"Extremely easy to use. Works really well for a simple calendar. Sometimes, notifications don't work unless multiple reminders are set for one event, though.",4
a52c2a05-7418-4ce5-8460-c36be7a53059,"My favourite app so far. But one minus - the notifications of events don't show up in the bar. I checked both the in-app& phone settings, but they still don't work. How can I change that?",4
286b319c-2f3a-4c40-8e8b-5ed065456817,Really a great calendar app. I'm glad I found it. The only flaw is that when you tap on things it reacts a bit slow.,4

97457af2-bf3f-49e3-9c44-b75181be1a97,"hi ! great app it's very complete :hundred_points: concerning the questions: could use some file sharing for images~ no collaborative features: i don't have to share this schedule and it's great, i just use it for :sparkles:personal use:sparkles: and i love it~ and i don't know why i would use messaging for tbh~ could also use the widget a lil smaller but that's just a personal~ keep it great :sparkles: and please keep it free haha",4

6279b41e-6796-4ab6-b9a6-176139617fa4,"Simple design. Nice color customization. Your calendar is shared with 3th parties. 61Mb installed. (For devs: Sorry, i dont send emails.)",4
e525b2d1-f0ab-4f22-8ab6-92cca602dab3,Really good that it lets you customize. Very organised.:thumbs_up::thumbs_up:,4
fae9c0d4-3765-4f8c-ba22-403476b92dd9,"Minimalistic. Compact. A neat little thing that if used correctly, will actually better your life. It doesn't have a sync feature, as it doesn't have a desktop app, but as it is, it's pretty satisfactory.",4
2dd470ca-612d-4432-9df0-1243f8544329,"this app is great if u don't want the pre installed calendar to sync with it. its also very easy to use and very customizable, I would recommend if u need a good calendar app",4
75587eb2-9d95-422d-af32-a4771757028e,good except no holidays included,4

5d9e23fb-83f0-419f-bf9a-414b9605c001,"It doesn't have any holidays that are against my religion on here such as LGBTQ stuff, you get to choose what you want to have on this calendar and remove things as you wish. Pretty good, way better that Google calander in which I can't remove things",4
4319a1be-e2ec-4554-bc9b-8e893b170286,No holidays listed.. Nice planner that you can't plan around holidays... Ish.,4
61180063-56e6-4ace-8375-79740e8b85a4,Nice app. Only problem is that it doesn't send you notifications which is crucial when you need to remember stuff.,4

cdbaf08b-bd3d-4353-aeda-3c4d5f3b2e17,"It's pretty useful, simple and nice, the features and designs aren't complicated or hard to search for within the app. The way of adding tasks to each day is the best, it feels like putting sticky notes! I recommend this calendar app:)",4
298148df-5a10-4d38-a3c2-49ab762656ba,"Pretty good. You can make the font smaller in the settings menu if you want to fit more in each day. Cool colour options to make looking at calendar and planning a life less stressful. Sometimes when you scroll through the pop-up calendar from month to month when making a booking, it lags and you need to do it again. 10 bucks is also pretty steep for a calendar app. But all in all, pretty good.",4
56db4fa7-3ec3-41de-9389-980e97c864e7,Inspirational it's easy to use it's not complicated as long as it's easy to move through what I need to put on my calendar very good,4

6dc58daf-a38a-4824-a538-daf70518316c,"The interface is simple but very pretty, and I like how easy it is to see what events are happening, easy also to set notifications or adjust event details. I find it a much better app to use than the Google Calendar lol.",4
f810fedc-b2b8-435d-9103-926c51e25fe6,i wish I could customize my own colors but other than that it's a very clean and nice so to use for a school calendar!,4

5ee619aa-106a-4263-921b-ef4602d28634,I love this app because it has so many cool features to it and you can customise your calendar how you like. The only problem is that you can't save your data to other devices so if you want to use the app on a different device you need to copy it in manually.,4
b857e936-75d4-49e0-91cf-d53a64d1d4e9,"I like it ,it has password and backup feature, and I like that:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up:",4

7f173348-49ba-45be-a4ed-887c6bf36acb,I can see this I have maculated to generation and I needed a calendar. I could see but I wish I could populated to my other devices. How do I do that,4
a025f30d-968c-4b23-9c17-7b6687248efa,good simple calendar,4
a45e8507-11e3-45e1-852b-cdb9e36806c5,"Overall good simple calendar, I particularly like that it doesn't sync to my phone calendar. One update I'd really like to see is the ability to zoom in and make each time slot bigger. When I schedule anything for less than 30 minutes I can't see the text/name of the task, instead I have to click into the task to see it. If I could zoom in I could get better focus on a shorter space of time, rather than being always zoomed out looking at 10 full hours.",4
065e5aad-887c-4166-972c-ec3181bd6e3c,"I like that 1) it is just a calendar, without trying to integrate with the rest of my environment, and 2) it smoothly scrolls vertically in month view so you can more easily see several weeks that span 2 months.",4

6f003957-cdf7-49af-8ab1-2d2b69e8194b,"Very nice app, taking away one star for one super annoying thing. Inside an event there is a field to enter a note but when your note is long there is no way to scroll it. You have to edit the event, then enter to edit the note and only then you can scroll too see full of it. If it wasn't for that o would give it 5",4
de9b95a8-64f1-4d41-bd19-bfee16d09bb1,Good app but no information on local holiday,4
68c9d03f-bd7b-47ab-8690-b76b8fa505e0,"The app is great, neat, simple and user friendly. Would be wonderful if public holidays of different countries were included:) Though it maybe difficult as it is based in Japan.:)",4

c8a8146a-c6eb-416d-b6d1-d2a0a402b8e0,its very easy to use and its not like other calenders that I had were its very hard to label it its actually very easy u just have to click on it chose a color and title it like how u want to label it to say idk like happy birthday...,4

56f38291-9d6b-4cfe-941b-089a2b53079c,it's a good app if you need a separate calendar. simplistic UI and overall pretty nice to use.,4
32675031-7b6e-4406-a919-ce108850a841,This is the ONLY calendar that actually works well without making you pay or bombarding with ads! I am planning on upgrading to the pro version eventually just because I enjoy customizing and organization but you don't even have to if your schedule is simple.,4
620d0969-7d80-4538-b8a9-c73ae7ebefa5,seems good,4
17beb850-ad74-4ac0-b163-ab299f14d032,"Amazing application! Simple to use, easy to understand, with the possibility of free customization (no paid pro app) and use of widgets on the display. Great!

f5392039-6e76-4ab9-a8ed-3f9f573dd550,I love everything about this app only thing I wish it had was a better widget and I would give it a 5 star rating. If I could rate it 4.5 that would be my rate for now.,4

23de4869-32e4-4a14-9e9c-d5f2dc14065b,Does it simply and is well thought out,4
5a9d7363-944e-4b93-b70c-33312001810f,"this is a great stand alone calendar app, the only feature I would ask for is the ability to use custom colours as I would like to use the same colours I use in my journal but some of the colours aren't available",4
