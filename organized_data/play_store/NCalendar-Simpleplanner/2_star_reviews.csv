As they are located in different places, the link between the location input and map interface would have been a great improvement of this app. For example, it doesn't drop down any location suggestions when I start typing the address.

Now if you have a scheduled event and you move it to the next month, the calendar moves it automatically to the day *before* the date you chose. You can only get the right date by deleting the event and creating a new one each time. IOW, for anyone who needs to reschedule events frequently, the app is now useless.",2

40a48810-770c-4559-ab14-7159ec682219,Really annoyed. Why did everything disappear? I really enjoy this calendar and I use it for my finances. I guess that was a poor decision. I had meticulously organized things and all my data has disappeared! It should have automatic backup first off when I go in to restore data it says I have to export excetera.,2
d3e40986-0715-4805-9a51-41d97eb39be6,"So the app was fine at first- i like the ability to customize different events with colors. But it randomly stopped sending me reminders... i checked that notifications were enabled in the app & my phone settings, and it was turned on as normal. I messed around with it for a bit trying to fix the issue but ended up saying screw it and downloading a different app. The notification aspect was the whole reason i needed the app to begin with.",2
