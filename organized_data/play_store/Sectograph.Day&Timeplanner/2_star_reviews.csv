757524aa-5567-4ef3-85da-6afb7f8d7cf4,"I was looking for a local calendar option to keep high priority ""task sets"" quarantined from my general daily activity chart, and to use as a box tracking varient. There is no option for this, as even trying to set up a local (offline) calendar, the App still requests permission to access the local calendar App, which is not what I require. It's a shame because a running tracker like this is exactly what I need for tracking specific task sets without external distractions.",2

I would pay $5 for a watch face. .....Why even make a program like this if you're not going to have something practical and usable on a daily basis like a digital smartwatch.

70a1fd66-48e4-4d8f-a94e-1456b72e8dc8,"Using this app for only 4 days as I wanted to schedule my tasks and time more effectively. The clock feature is a unique idea. Adverts are minimal, in fact I barely notice them. The main issue is that rescheduling a task can be very long winded and changing the time too. App appears easier to use in comparison to others. My suggestions is that they include more colours, that rescheduling is made easier and that the clock feature is more inline with the time of day, where tasks can't be hidden.",2

ae72da8d-1850-44fb-a068-97ba7d408efc,It took me 3 days to figure that my outlook work calendar not syncing was not the app's fault but a company IT policy issue. I don't understand why you don't point users in the right direction in your FAQ? You're probably loosing quite a few potential clients who probably just give up where they could just chat to their IT administrator to sort it out.

The simplest things are constantly being displayed differently all over the app. While you can customise tons of color settings in premium, there is just no sensical priority to what gets shown big.

I uninstalled and installed it again w hopes it would go away. And then i tried to see if i could find information about this issue and the app and that is very limited. Very disappointed as i loved the app and used it everyday.,2

Can't even click on the event to see, I have to go to a different calendar app to see what I have to do. Which is the one thing a calendar widget should do for you. Edit: in response to the creator's response to my comment, it IS important to keep in mind that this is a free app, with no possibility to upgrade, meaning this is not a professionally-developed app, so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality. So if what you're looking for is a free app, then this might be a good app for you. However, if you're looking for a calendar/agenda app, then probably not.",2

90e8ca67-38f1-486d-a761-a36de0903ce5,I'm not digging the new widget design. I don't like the time in the middle now and I hate having to touch the little icon. It was better when you could just touch the main part of the widget.,2

9a1354b5-650f-4656-a378-77331855feba,The app idea is quite great. The app itself needs to be improved thought. The clock keeps getting stuck on fixed times and updates the time only when we open the app itself. This defeats the whole purpose of the app. Definitely a 5 star idea. Needs better execution.,2

649034b0-400f-4276-8d30-1c23763cf8be,"Easily my most relied upon app. 'At a glance' usage for sure. Some suggestions I have would be to: 1: Be able to click on a particular event on the widget and have it take me directly to event details (I get that I can do that already by going into the app and tapping on the listed events but I want to eliminate that extra step) 2: Have the widget be smart enough to ask which event (in the case of tapping on an event that overlaps another) Thank you for an amazingly simple and effective app! Edit (2/15/17): Holy crap, you guys listened...I don't have much to say other than may your team enjoy years of success with this and any other future projects you have in mind. Definitely a dedicated group of developers, for sure. Bug Update: Another day, another bug eh? Anyways, don't know if it was intentional...when enabling the option to have a minute scale on both widget and app, it causes a 'tick' sound at every passing minute. The 'tick' sound is the same as the touch sounds made when the user taps on an icon of any kind. Again, don't know if it was on purpose, just might be something you need to look into...maybe make it into a separate option the user can toggle on and off.",2
