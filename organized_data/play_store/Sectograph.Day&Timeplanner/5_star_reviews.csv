298bda35-6d89-421f-922c-9a6f73388ae5,The Sectograph app is a great tool for tracking your day and time. It's easy to use and provides a lot of valuable insights.

This is the only app I have ever bought the pro version for, even better that it's a 1-time buy. If you're neurospicy & looking for a better way to visualize your calendar, this is it. I hope they'll add: -ability to set a custom notification sound -unlimited event categories & colours. That's all I can think of to improve. How many apps only need a couple of tweaks?

1548ce4b-e71a-4ed0-8087-084805aacd72,I love this app and the way it displays my calendar!! I also absolutely love the Wear OS integration!! When I found out this can be a watch face I got a smart watch literally just for that!! One setting that's needed: It would be helpful if the day or multiple days long events can be hidden on the widget and watch face. Or a setting where it can be tucked inside the arcs/events diameter. Having a separate diameter specifically for day long events is nice but it makes the watch face smaller.,5

I love that it syncs up to my Google calendar, so setup was fast. I love how large I can scale the widget up. I immediately payed for the premium version so I could access the 24hr clock face & have no regrets. (Esp when most planner apps are now subscription, a $4, 1-time charge is more than reasonable.)

Only it takes a bit time to sync with google calender, but thats okay.",5
68fca80d-5f85-4f7c-b78f-e775e3265071,"For visual people with busy calendars. 1. Limiting the calendar events to a 12 hour view cycle helps keep the focus in the present. 2. Shows the time left to the next task subtly. 3. Really fun to turn the ""hand"" to a time you want to visualize. E.g. It's 10pm. Turn the hand to 7am and visualise the things you'd do at that point. Done? Click a cute button to move the hand back to actual time and go to sleep prepared for the next day. This has been clearly thought through. Kudos. Thank you. :-)",5

My only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment (events) and the option to link a segment to a checklist.

Edit: I forgot to mention the watch face and app. I have used the same watch face now for 2 years. This app replaced my Pear watch face and I haven't looked back!",5

ca7f2efd-70e9-4ea7-afbf-1f2e884efb01,"This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!",5

Also it would be nice to have an option in the settings for making the watch 24 hours always, currently if I restart my watch it switches back to 12 hours, so I have to turn on the tap to toggle feature, tap my watch, then turn off the tap to toggle feature since I don't want to accidentally switch it back.",5

aed729a6-f18e-4430-a41e-7bb936957cdc,Very happy with this application. It does exactly what it's supposed to do which is copy your calendar onto a clock face. This makes it visually easier to understand and predict to do time management. At least that's what it does for me. You can try at the free version and then go for the paid version if you want to change some of the graphics and have other options. Don't take my word for it obviously downloaded tried out make sure your calendars are active and everything will fall in place.,5

The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed.

1eb5a8aa-ff69-4431-8821-f20db647001b,"Sectograph has tremendously altered my workday in a positive way. I am able to plot out the time I will begin a task, how long I anticipate the task will take to complete, and easily and quickly move tasks around as needed. The visual sectograph is right on point and I appreciate it very much. I plot out the rime for the actual event or task and also account for preparation, travel, and buffer times so one delay doesn't throw my whole day off. I began using it only a few days ago and everything about my workday has changed for the better. I am more in control and it shows. My coworkers and my manager see and feel a big difference, not only in how much I am getting done, but also in my happier appearance :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: and my seeming more focused. I am also plotting out my personal tasks and events which is forcing me to stick to promises and avoid being late. Much love :red_heart: love :red_heart: love :red_heart: for sectograph.",5

I'm going to pick up a cheap tablet and stick it up next to the server racks with this app running to help schedule the backups and daily admin. I will certainly be upgrading to the paid version for the extra customisation options and look forward to future developments. Edit: could ability to show reminders from Google calendar and Google keep be added to features list. (I use one application that only sets reminders not calendar events that is fairly critical to projects) Loving the new dark theme :),5

Not only does Sectograph work reliably, it improves on 12Hours' implementation by adding customisable hour and minute hands, more display options, much-improved whole-day event display, and more.

I love having translucent sectors but I also love being able to categorize my activities by colour. Currently, even with the RM9.99 extension i can only make the default colour translucent. And when I use event colour, google doesnt have a translucence option for their colours. If you do make a patch for this, I hooe it wont be in another extension that I would have to pay for.",5

e851db0e-91b0-4ef4-92c8-3600bb6fe91c,"Definitely a great app with multiple invisible hotspots on the widget to replace your app icons. I replaced my homescreen with the widget and connected all apps I had on it to the widget and wouldn't have it any other way anymore. Just make sure to set your phone settings to allow the app to work in the background. The app goes a great way in letting you customise and personalise the widget's color settings, timeframes for how long events stay up once they're finished and also how early they show up so you get the best experience possible. It's fully compatible with the default calender of your phone, how it fares with Google calender or other apps, I don't know since I only use the default calender app. I hope my review helps :)",5
7195c012-9096-454c-9bf9-591d849a3589,"Important suggestion: google calendar reminders to appear in widget as well, not just events. This is awesome and the idea is perfect but it has so much more potential to improve. I am eager for the future versions and improvements.",5

Until I edited it to my liking and searched the app around to find out how to look at the clock provided. I like how I can see my entire day in a widget. I think what would make it perfect would be to allow this app be compatible with smart watches. Also, if we could have the choice of making events easily without jumping to Google calendar, I think that'd be even better! Overall great job! I like this app :)",5

ece0633f-3a60-4222-888c-92be700e1da8,"Congratulations! Google should buy your company and hire your whole Dev team! This app is an example of cooperative design philosophy, instead of making you use their own calendar implementation it works WITH the native calendar app letting it handle everything it can and should handle, and limits itself to doing one thing only, and do it well, in true UNIX tradition. The visualization is intuitive and so useful, I always wanted a schedule visualization like this, but it goes beyond that, the wise use of symbols and sectors conveys maximum information without clutter, if you run a complex schedule THIS is the app to make sense of it. That being said, there are a few areas that can and should be improved, but a kind and quick to respond Dev team fills in that gap. Design decisions were made that you will be thankful for: it does require a HUGE widget, but allows you to map any app to it's peripheral buttons which is a fair trade for the kind of screen realestate it requires. You guys are off to a tremendous start with this execllent app, Its the kind of app that exposes the potential of a computing platform like Android to actually make your life better !!!! Thanks!",5

f7594653-0f80-47a2-b9aa-81b8039739f7,"1)WHY THIS APP IS NEEDED? When live in a tremendously competitive & challenging age that expects us to accomplish more, achieve greater, become the best, give more of ourselves, & to these things & more, within tbe same 24hrs that we've always been confined to. It has become understood, accepted, expected, & even normal, to set our personal goals & aspirations much higher than we ever have before.....& at any cost. We have chosen to place a tremendous importance, on seeing ourselves achieve excellence in both our professional goals & personal growth in our lives, causing our greatest dreams to become reality. From each of our smallest steps & milestones, to our greatest of accomplishments, our drive & persuit toward sucess, tries us with refining & strengthening us every step of our journey to greatness. Our discipline & focus in learning all that we can & in growing to our minds fullest potential, combined with our willingness to do whatever we can to achieve all that we possibly can hope for or imagine, is such a testimony to the fact that the that the human mind is a much greater power source than any weapon made by the hands of man. We sometimes find that the actions that these aspirations require, turn out to be, some greatly difficult accurances. They can be extremely stressful, & at times they may feel physically, mentally, & emotionally impossible in may circumstances. Any one who could use a visual schedule helper/habit or event reminder, would greatly benefit from this application. It provides a clear quick visual understanding of how much time is reasonably available for each & every task, habit, event, etc. Therefore, one is less likely to forget an event, or fail at making hapits routine & managing time. This app helps you to maximize your time, eliminate time waste, & struggle less as you attempt to manage difficulties within a hectic lifestyle within your daily schedule that seems it cannot take on, or support anymore tasks/goals. This is an incredibly helpful visual tool in helping anyone in search of time management, as well as being helpful in assisting anyone in prioritizing, eliminating time wasters, & with maximizing important things while using specific time allotments for everything in your life beginning with the most important to the least.",5

It's tough for me to remember those things, so I use this as a widget and when I check my tablet in the morning, I'm reminded that I have certain tasks that may have been forgotten in the whirlwind of everyday operations. The calendar app on my tablet just doesn't cut it, but this literally divides my day(s) and what I need to prioritize in a way that makes sense to me. Thanks.",5

f77cafb4-6889-4890-b322-10b95a504752,"This is an absolutely brilliant visualization of the day. Very creative. I have some suggestions to improve the implementation: 1. You've already said you're working on a 24-hour view. That's ok, but it would be nice for people who prefer a 12-hour view to be able to switch between AM and PM, especially in the widget. Maybe a tap on the center switches the view, and a long press goes to the application? 2. The widget definitely doesn't stretch. On my Samsung S7, I gave it an entire screen to itself, and it is using only about half of the width. Is that something you can fix? 3. I would like to add my voice to those asking you to make a lock screen widget. That would be incredible. Thanks for a great product! EDIT AFTER RECEIVING DEVELOPER'S RESPONSE: Thanks for the quick response! I am looking forward to seeing the next release. Oh, and by the way, I showed the widget to my 17-year-old son, who (like all 17-year-olds) is never impressed with anything. He thought it was cool. Nice job!",5

e1cb97af-07eb-4cfb-aa5a-31e144521faa,"This is brilliant! Best widget ever! I like how it will use your calendars own colors, shows the time in between events, and the outer rings. It's so helpful in staying on task and being punctual. On my phone (OnePlus One with LineageOS) it makes the click noise every time the minute hand changes. Can that be turned off? It's annoying, but I just turned off touch sounds globally for the phone so it's no longer a problem. Thank you for creating this gem!!!",5
