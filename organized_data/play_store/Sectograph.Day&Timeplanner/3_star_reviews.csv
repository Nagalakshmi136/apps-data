b1c67a39-e6f0-49e9-9254-f867f01b6552,I like the app the style and the design of the widget but not sure why but nothing happens when I click on the widget if I want to add or edit anything the widget doesn't do anything I have to search for the app and open it :confused_face: I'll keep trying to play with it till I figure out the issue,3
9e7e9fbe-4fe5-42c9-8ff7-06143dfeceb1,I love this app but the widget resizes itself all the time so will not give it five stars until that is fixed. I am using Nova Launcher and no other widget behaves this way. Edit: The widget is now utterly broken in Nova Launcher 8. Changed stars to one until this is fixed.,3

Customizing it can be overwhelming at first but the customizability is also what makes it work so well. Here's the unfortunate thing though... just upgraded to the Pixel Watch 3 and the app doesn't support it. I can't honestly hold it against the developer because it just released, but definitely disappointed because it's by far my most used watch",3

cc08d741-8ba0-4678-86f4-1a4b33ac0876,"This watch face is easily one of the best I've ever come across. However, the watch face lacks many of the features that are available for the widget. For example, sector colors are unavailable on the watch. The only customization available is individual color changing. Even then, gradients are unavailable. if the watch face was given a refresh to add some of the features that are already available on the widget, this would easily be the best productivity watch face on the market.",3

a1aca131-2980-45a2-96be-f8168c37956f,I have been using this app for a about 4 years through various iterations of my phone. I love the idea of seeing what you are doing as clock... A very interesting visual. But the main problem is if your calendar is cluttered viewing on this app will make it harder.. else you can make it work,3
72f28cb5-2a50-43e6-8486-0844d42b62dd,"The app serves well to help with time perception. However, I wish the reminder included a loud alarm, instead of only the notification. If you are listening to some audio book or podcast and your screen is away, you might miss the notification for the reminders. We don't always have our phones right next to us and if an alarm option is also included with reminders, it would eliminate the need for us to rely on one more app to set up the alarms.",3

35216577-7ebd-40e7-96d6-c154758a6fb6,"Wonderful app, unique and very useful, great design and functionality. But....customizing colors and transparency of the sectors remains cumbersome. There's one sector transparency slider in Widget palette section that mostly does nothing. And there's another one for the same purpose in general settings that actually changes transparency. How to change colors and transparency of events is a mystery to me as there are also several ways to do it and none seem to work. In short, it's still a mess.",3

However, if device free space runs low calendar events that aren't full day events will no longer display on the widget or in the app, and the app wont be able to tell if calendars are added modifed, or removed.

f5ab0acd-2bbd-406c-a11c-24e96b04c1cf,OK this app is seriously game changing for the neurodivergent mind!!! I have add and I've always really struggled with time management because it just doesn't compute for my brain and I often overestimate what I'm able to accomplish in a day. With this app I'm able to visually SEE how my day fits together and where there are gaps between scheduled events/tasks that I can fit something in. I honestly can't recommend this enough if you have add too! I just wish I had more colors to choose from.,3
f7b7b13d-f88b-4401-8514-64dacb6ae13e,Love it but it doesn't sync at all with Google calendar. Only does half of my events,3

3ab17b65-a973-45b2-8262-d8c067251bf8,Good app to track but needs improvements. 1. There's no shortcut to mark the task completed for the event 2. Tasks in calendar view doesn't show strike out which you see on day view 3. There should be notification/alarm sound or alert to dismiss for the reminders,3
2e3e6d66-b4ac-4ccd-9844-b3ca674ce82b,"I like the concept and the execution. Regretfully, I cannot use it. I use my calendar for events, reminders, and tasks, so it is very, very busy. I really wish it would work for me. Nicely done! Now if you could do that for a to-do list that would actually use the phone's audible alarms --- yes, that might hold my interest. It would need a couple different things than a calendar, but that might be a very nice adaptation of this app. Well done, good luck!",3

f7417f2d-0cc8-45ed-9245-00bb8a76d452,"I love the concept, but there are a few things I wish were different on the watch version: 1) option to keep current time pegged to ""3 o'clock"" position with events rotating around the dial -- this is similar to my other favorite watch face where the entire dial rotates 2) overlapping events from different calendars should be different widths -- they are difficult to read and even when opacity is set lower, perceiving them as different events is messy 3) tapping an event should bring up a card",3

For myself, having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value. If the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect ""real time"" I'll give it a 5, otherwise the App wont work for me and it stays at a 3.
