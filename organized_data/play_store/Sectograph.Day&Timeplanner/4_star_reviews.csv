27bfbeb5-501e-4784-8668-ea565dfac529,"Amazing app. The settings are terribly disorganized and confusing but the widget is so useful to me that I'm still giving it 5 stars. Please fix the settings though, they're the worst.",4
716950f9-7f25-43fd-bbd3-b5373e1d08a5,The cyclical nature of the clock face makes calendar events less daunting than an endless to do list to oblivion. Psychologically freeing and easy to see your day at a glance.,4

b04aa85e-931a-4521-9529-3d7220eeb068,"Really one of the best time blocking apps out there, i think the notifications could be a little more pushing and they could have made the ui a little bit prettier but still a good app nevertheless. Would be cool if they added more advanced/detailed features tho like habit tracking and other stuff like that usually found in other apps. But if you just want timeblocking this app is the best",4

57e48e61-1c88-42b1-92b8-6e7c00db50f7,"I originally rated this app lower because the time scaling feature on the widget doesn't work on the watch face. The developer said that it's only been a week since that feature came to the widget. Fair enough, but unfortunately I just upgraded to the Galaxy watch 7. The watch face does not work on this device. This is due to new requirements from Google. Not the developers fault, but it doesn't state it must be WearOS 4.0 or lower in the App description. Hoping for an update. 4 stars for now.",4

2e2b2e9f-91dd-4bca-b85f-ab63a810747e,The only thing I would change is make it so I could drag and drop events I put in my calendar. Other than that it's a perfect scheduling app especially with the watch,4
c30b96af-71c5-4675-9e87-5e8fd384fb91,Like it. Would be 5 stars if clicking event location activated navigation like Google calendar does,4
0c20ae84-232f-4b2b-8e27-88a96adb3e18,This is best app but it will be much better if they add reminder option or alarms so we can get notified easily when we are wokring on same phne or tablets...otherwise this is such a good app,4

1b2593b5-559f-42ba-83a0-de2366c84a60,"I've been using the app for over 3 years now, and it has consistently helped me stay productive most days. It does take some getting used to when you start using it, but once you get a hang of it, there's no going back. As great as the app is, though, I'd really appreciate an alarm feature. The pop-up reminders are effective, but then I'm not always with my phone and could use the jolting reminder of an alarm without having to use a different app for that.",4

One thing I find hard is to keep the widget and watchface in sync: settings often have to be set for both.

99faaa4c-c19e-41c1-9532-60b15da68c05,Works well with a Samsung Galaxy watch & business calendar 2. There is an issue if you have touch the screen enabled as it will turn completely white & you have to reset the watch face. In a more recent update the times between sectors will scale down to fit in the space if there's no room which is very cool. I got the premium version quite a while ago & am very happy. The thing I would like is if theres an option to have overlapping sectors fade into each other.,4

Keeps a visual reminder of my upcoming meeting and appointments right there. Areas for improvement: 1. A very few items have not uploaded to the app or watch for some reason. 2. The app when new always seems to default to not updating the watch. 3. Let me dial the watch forward like the app so I can see events on future days,4

Let me create a template, where I can have an event set up with a particular duration (45 mins) and reminder alarms turned off, so that I don't have to keep customizing those details many times per day for many events. 2. You already have a setting for the default duration of an event, but there are only a few options. There should be a numeric dial where I can set any value from 1 to 1000.",4

The only flaws are that in order to use the app your calendar must be synced with it. Which means you cannot manually input your plans. I did sync my calendar (Google) however it did not show individual events and only showed 'goals' - and it is because of this that I cannot use this app unfortunately.,4

I'd love it if the watch face could get similar functionality (e.g., expanding events to see the details), as well as new functionality (e.g., complications, using the central button for something other than switching between 12- and 24-hour views (since I'm always in the 24-hour view anyway)). A few tips for users: - Make use of 0-minute events on Google Calendar. They look good on the app, and make up for Sectograph not being able to show the to-do list calendar for tasks with set times. (edit: Can you add this?) - For longer events (3 hours, by default), you end up with a flag with the first character of the event name. I use a Japanese character or a number (e.g., for variable shift work) as the first character for these kinds of events, but emoji would probably work great as well.",4

Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake.

For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me.

It's a sure sign that a product is good when you start to rethink planning and scheduling from the ground up. I also applaud the developer for taking a more nuanced approach by offering a robust and functional app (without tacky ads) with optional and significant add-on purchases. After using it for a week I'm ready to fully support the creators with a purchase--probably the highly customizable pallete chooser but I'm also curious about the 24 hour display function.

Also please make a preview of the clock in the settings so we won't need to switch from the app to the homescreen to see the changes. Really looking forward to see these features fixed.

9619fc66-6ec9-411c-a91a-8e5addd1d936,"I think this is a really ingenious way of looking at time. Four features I wish for: 1. The possibility to adjust the number of hours visible into the past as well as the number of hours visible into the future. (This also means I'd like to be able to control if there is a gap between the two.) 2. Alternatives to the fade effect. Events fading into each other and a dotted line across them. It all looks very cluttered and detracting to me. Instead I think I'd love an effect where the ends seem to go over each other (dropping a material style shadow). In a variant of this the top end (future) could curl towards the viewer, while the bottom end (if visible) would curl away from view. No dotted lines required. 3. Currently events occupying the same time block are blended on top of each other. This makes it very hard to distinguish and read the events. Instead I'd like to see the events side by side, sharing the space. (Note that this does not occur for daily events, which are displayed outside if the circle.) 4. The possibility to set the calendar disk turning instead of the clock arms, for example so that now is always up. Note to dev: you may want to make sure your app is also found when searching for ""circular calendar"". Only ""round calendar"" works for me.",4

All left out there in play store is that old school calendar planners... So good work.. Hope u take care of my suggestions I do hv some more suggestion but this may go long...so Keep up the good work",4

08436c32-d619-4d88-937a-04279874f950,I love this alternative to visualizing my do. A black (OLED) theme option would be nice. It's a different way to look at your day and it makes a lot more sense to some of us.,4

2e83dacb-038c-4517-963c-6e0ae6f0ba5a,i like to give it 4.5 star but dont know how to choose 1/2 a star. the app is a solid concept and well thought out. it can even be integrated with informant. improvement to make it 5. 1) user defined color slection for different calendar events. 2) sync from google calendar is erratic 3) max events displayed shd be 12hrs instead of 10 hrs 4) toggle between am/pm display shd be included. currently the app shows a lot of potential but is only fun to look at it until the above improvements r incorporated. i am keep the app in my phone for now,4
9751a2b9-d4cf-46cf-84f3-14c539b626d9,"Nice and helpful app. The widget is really useful and intuitive. The only this is that I would personally like to have a 24h view of my tasks and not only 12h per time. This app claims to be a ""time planner to control your work, events and tasks throughout the day"" but the clock design doesn't allow to see throughout the whole day. Maybe using only the hour bar moving along a 24h disk could solve the issue. It could be an option to add. Just a little advice for an almost perfect app! Thanks",4

000eb0f5-f15f-4d03-8d3f-7314d767a2fd,"Interesting app that seems pretty good so far... after a few days use I find I am keeping track of the day's plans and things aren't creeping up on me unexpectedly. However, I think it needs the widget to be used in a prominent position so it's always in view. On the (possible) down side is that all the appointments need a start and finish time if it's going to work correctly... I used to use 'all day' events for most things which don't work well in this app.",4
231056c9-c57c-422d-ad75-523d3d9bb0f6,"This is a genius idea! I love being able to see my calender like this. Once you click it's... Well a clock it just starts to make you think ""why has this not been done before"" 4 stars as I feel the integration with Google calender could be better, but I'm unsure if this is based on restrictions for the developer to interact with Google calenders through a 3rd party app",4

ba832f92-81db-4957-b88c-dd09ff56d592,It is simple and fast.,4
12cdae7a-186d-46e0-a64c-cb0a6b5653c8,Works pretty cool! I like the fact I can go right to my calendar.,4
b7fa78ed-d60c-49da-b90b-f6e2679a9f2a,Like it because by just open the phone I can see the time and what do I have next,4
799597b8-3e6e-4f65-bd73-31d33d99403c,Not sure why this works better than other calendar apps for me but it does. I wouldn't mind more control over the appearance but I'm otherwise happy.,4
0eba5ae3-230c-4de2-bc8f-671f7ba02261,Good app. Innovative ideas. How can I sync my Outlook calendar in this? That is something is much needed,4

1f76b2cf-03bb-46ea-8dd9-9f8e69c5708b,"I think this is great, but would be amazing with a bit of improvement. I'd love to have more customisation options on the look of the widget. Display overlapping events better, maybe have the longer overlapping even on the inside half and shorter ones around the outside half of the circle. Similar to the all day events at the moment. Icons instead of/as well as text. Great work keep it up! Edit: Also the ability to change the day forward or backward on the widget would be great (maybe flip the colours when it's on a day other than today to stop confusion)",4
25366041-ea3f-4383-94d6-4112ce70bbd4,nice app! it would be great if events are overlapped newer event (if more then again shorter etc etc) could be shorter with borders to visual highlight it!,4

2c6feb67-296f-4e91-9a44-6529da768f69,For a free app this is a pretty awesome little widget. I honestly wish I had a busier calendar to see what it could do,4

815d6406-366e-45d3-a7dd-f5c1aff7ac2e,Fantastic concept! Put it in the middle of my home screen. One thing that bugs me though is that it's not good at showing overlapping events.,4

b689c560-6493-4fc3-a933-60acf00419a4,"Much like the commenter below who asked you to add Tasks availability (I'd appreciate this feature too), it would be one of the most efficient productivity apps (5 stars, easy!) if Google Goals & Reminders were integrated. When they're on my calendar, but not on S.graph, I miss important parts of my day. Your purpose is defeated if I have to click into the calendar to see how my time is blocked out. I tried un/reinstalling and refreshing the viewable calendars, but with no luck, so only Events will display.",4

c0bdc60d-70bc-40bc-954e-64082e534389,App with great potential. Been looking for years and finally! Nice and simple UI but I agree with previous suggestions: 1) quick add event 2) sub events (tasks) like in Sooner app 3) more themes 4) larger widget size 5) accommodate longer text 6) 24hour events . Still rate 5* for being the best calendar clock for now.,4

Share same view as others (great on smaller displays.... ) but really interested in the permissions with regard to emailing my contacts without me knowing... I support your work (purchased pro clock set awile back) and was wondering if you could clarify to what extent your app will assume liberties?
