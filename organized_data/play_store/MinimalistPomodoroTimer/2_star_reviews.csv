The vibration notification doesn't work with the app. I checked with other pomodoro apps and the problem doesn't lie with my phone. It is a crucial feature for me as I plan to use this app in the library, with phone on vibration mode. Is there a solution to this problem?",2

If I interfere with the breaks/sessions at all, like having to pause a break and resume it later, I simply don't get the 15-min breaks when I should (if at all). Gestures are frustrating/nonintuitive. Also don't always get the workday start reminder (or it's late). And the app being fullscreen is aggravating, I tire of fighting that only for it to go back to that presentation--settings don't help. Disappointed.",2

It have Google account sync option and statistics export via csv file. It have all features one can have for a perfect pomodoro.

7cddb1c8-4dce-4796-a500-6e11c6560ba5,Need Tutorials. It is not working how originally thought. From what I can tell is that it is going to record whenever the time reached the end and not whenever you switch labels which means you can't record breaks if you happen to take a break in the middle of a focused session. Possibly this will encourage me to complete tasks before taking a break and make me more productive or at least sit still until the duration of the work period ends.,2

dfee98a8-a88a-494f-9058-5c57cacf6643,Many features require paid upgrade. There's also this dot of light that constantly moves back and forth across the timer numbers whenever you use it. It's extremely distracting. I was disappointed that the dot couldn't be turned off. You can't label tasks you're timing without paid upgrade.,2
a09a7bd8-4a2a-4a26-b256-a08bd1ebd20b,"I think I'll put 5 stars here first and see how it goes. My review is based on the following two points: - the minimalist interface that I really love - there are some useful functions and features to choose from to personalize the app, without making it too confusing. Trust me there are apps that claim to be simple but offer tons of redundant functions. I've purchased the pro version to support the development team. Keep up the good work!",2

When my phone is locked the counting would be hidden. Need ubdate for it's design. Thank you !!,2
