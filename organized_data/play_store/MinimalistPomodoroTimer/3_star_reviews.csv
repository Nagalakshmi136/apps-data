f8ed93bd-5985-4385-9c41-11252022ac1d,"I really hope my review could be considered some day. I missed a vital feature in the app: the timer doesn't keeps going (with a overtime) and stops only when I stop it manually. This is essential because if I'm working in critical tasks and I am almost finished with the task, I won't stop doing it as I'm in the very end. So, you could add a option for the user to choose if, when the timer ends, it instantly stops or if it keeps going with a overtime until user stops it manually.",3
85d46903-f079-4ee5-a291-604bb4086f82,"It's a good app but it's been many years since its release and still lacks some essential features: Widgets and Subtasks (Sub-labels). Other minor improvements would be a goal completion rate and an option for notifications to be based on normal volume (My phone is always on silent and that's impossible if I want to hear the finish work/break notifications unless I switch to override alarm but then my alarm would be too low the mornings). Sadly, I don't think these features will be implemented",3

Sometimes it gets confusing when you've got &lt; 5 mins, whether you're still in productive time or whether you'd missed the alert and it's now rest time. Edited because I've found 2 bugs: 1. sometimes the pause button doesn't work 2. I'd worked up to 3 rounds of 25 min productivity, but I'd reset it to zero (0). After a little while, I'd gone back to work with the app. Once I'd finished the first round of 25 mins (because of the counter is back to zero), it immediately went to a 30 min rest period, still thinking that the counter had just finished the fourth round.",3
