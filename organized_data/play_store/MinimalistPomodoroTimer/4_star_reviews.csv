11242009-aaed-4f72-b3b9-c81c0a8a9a8c,"Really good app which can be almost perfect. Being a student I (and many people) are not able to buy premium. There should be a free feature added where in free version, user gets 3 or 5 free tags to use and to exceed that limit, you will have to buy the premium. I really think this should be added to free features. The app will be jus perfect. I know premium is a 1 time purchase but it will be awesome for students and some others. Also a web app should be made which will sync the user's data.",4

c0d4bc20-d8b2-4408-bb30-581adf6032e7,The app is great. It's simple and shows all the options and data I need but I paid for it and was dissapointed that the difference between the dark and not dark version is just 1% lighter. When I turned off the dark version I was expecting something close to white. Please add a light theme to it as well.,4

When it is running and you put down the phone and then when you start the phone you will see the homepage ( even when the mobile is lock ) so checking out the timer is very easy.,4

It could use more restricted permissions to be 5 stars (I fail to see the need for full network access for example) Edit: indeed I forgot that you can set the app to disconnect you from the world while working. I don't use it but it explains the permission requirement.",4

One more thing for perfection would be the option to have multiple configurations for pomodori.. Like multiple copies of the settings for different stuff. I.e one for studying with the disturb mode on, one for working with more work time etc and you could select the configuration when starting.. And last one, option to disable internet (both wifi + data) not only wifi",4

8d6c70dc-9f98-4535-b9af-0246ec73b167,"This app has the potential to be the best. Well, it needs more features. 1) Changing the sounds. 2) More flexible time selection. 3) Tasker support. 4) Time remaining on the notification. Also, logs, and statistics (I don't need it though).",4
