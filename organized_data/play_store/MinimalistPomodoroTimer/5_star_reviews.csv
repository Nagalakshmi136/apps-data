96023350-e0ab-4c45-823a-b34f56c549a5,I love the simplicity of this app. It does exactly what it's supposed to do (without fail I might add) and it doesn't demand any personal details to be able to use the app like so many of the other apps out there unnecessarily do. It also seems to use less battery than some of the other Pomodoro apps so even if you're using the app for long periods - e.g. your work day - you don't notice much difference to your battery level. Great app! Highly recommend.,5

It works for me because you know you have 25 minutes to really focus and you just get stuck in and the next thing you know, you've got a break time. I use my 5 minutes break to stretch so I'm not sitting all day. I'm really happy with this app as you can add extra minutes or pause it.

Its one of my most used apps that i use everyday. Some features i think it needs that would make it better are: a) having the countdown timer preview and appear whilst not in the app like where it says ""work in progress"" to check the timer without needing to open the app. b) having an option to set how long the alarm goes for at the end of each section. The alarm needs more than 1 beep.",5
