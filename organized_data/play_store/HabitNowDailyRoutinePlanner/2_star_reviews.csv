Already in love with it even though I am having limited features (aka i am using the free version :face_with_hand_over_mouth:) but i am thinking to go for premium. It is so less pricey in compare to other apps. There is only one feature missing and that is a MOOD TRACKER. Please people, bring it in, I guess then your app would be a whole package deal. Awaiting for the feature!!!",2

Initially, mostly there was a few minutes delay. After reaching out to support it worked for a while. But after the app update, reminders are not on time again and multiple for the same.

The limit of 8 repeating tasks/habits makes it useless for me, and the fact checklists are a premium only feature really drags it down because honestly that's the best feature.
