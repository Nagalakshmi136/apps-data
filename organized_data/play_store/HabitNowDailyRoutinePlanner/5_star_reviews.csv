I absolutely love its features and the fact that I can separate my one-time tasks and recurring tasks and habits. Then, the tasks and habits can be put into different categories, which I found to be so helpful. The plus is that you can add and customize your own categories. The premium membership is so affordable, and it is a lifetime subscription. I absolutely love the app.",5

It also allows you to set as many single tasks as you would like to set reminders to do different things. So starting out with just 7 recurring let's you test it out to see if it helps and if it does its only a one time purchase of $5 to get everything. I would highly recommend this app.,5

I was looking for an app that would enable me to track all my habits and routines in one place. The premium version has habits with a checklist, which I use for routines/chained habits. I love that it's a one-time purchase. The only thing I'm missing is statistics of all the habits combined in one view, e.g. on Monday you did 8/10, on Tuesday 9/10 etc., not just tracking each habit separately. :blue_heart:",5

It would be great to see something like this in the app. Great job on the app.,5

Useful for bad habits you're trying to quit, which means they are not ""active"" stuff you have to do. - When creating an item with the ""+"" button, automatically open ""Habit"", ""Task"" or ""Recurring task"" depending on which sub menu you are currently in.

It has all the features I wanted in habit tracking app, wish I had found it earlier. My only request is PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE allow us our own sorting on to-dos and habits/tasks etc by long pressing and sliding them up and down, instead of having default order for habits. I'll keep looking forward to this feature and will be much grateful :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",5

557064d5-5151-4be8-98ae-234af5b711cf,Many of my reccuring tasks are ones which I set an AT LEAST amount for my self (i.g. once a month) and the more I do the better. So there should an option to set recurring tasks done more than the set amount. You may remove the task from daily list but one can set it done from a menu or s.th then it's added to that day's tracked tasks/habits. Just acknowledge this feedback and I change it to 5 star again.,5

Another recommendation includes allowing the user to adjust the placement/priority of each task within a routine. Those updates would make this app unstoppable!,5

Full marks to the developer for minimalistic yet functional app. I have two suggestions for further impovement. 1. Can you have goals and habit sections where in we can have a view of our bigger goals and daily habit tracking(these habit can link with the goal ) 2. Can you please add option to make a sound or notification when we complete a habit. It will work as a reward Many thanks. Well done.,5

The free version itself has so many options. The tasks and habits are clear. Shows if they are done or not effectively. And the tasks pend till the next day until u finish it(that is also optional and u can switch off when u dnt need it to pend) haven't still seen ads so far. Highly recommend. Will definitely upgrade to premium when I am capable.,5

50a0ef67-f5c1-4969-9be4-dbc3911f72fe,"Hey guys. Just purchased your app and would absolutely love if you guys modified it to track all data input. For example, if I am tracking my reading and I am aiming for 2 chapters but only got 1 chapter done, it doesn't factor in the 1 chapter into the stats. This is essential in keeping accurate data, rather than being given a 0% when some of it was in fact accomplished. Also please allow for customization where you can drag and drop your habits in the order you'd like to see them. Thank you!",5

This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits. And it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything. Other apps give little functionality before you have to pay.,5

801daab5-f7ca-4950-815a-bc4ee297a7ce,Really helpful. I like that I get reminders in the morning about what's on my agenda for the day. I like that I can check them off and they move to the bottom of the lotst as they are completed. I like that it reminds me later in the day to revisit my list. Easy to use.,5

I don't need hundreds of tasks organized in a hierarchy, just a simple app to keep my goals in sight. This app does it with a beautiful easy-to-read interface. Tip: You have to be creative with the sorting order to make it work for you. For example, I sort my today list by: 1. Priority; 2. Habits first. 3. Time. It works beautifully for me.",5
2e9b2eb3-3ea6-471e-ba75-2917e13ae8ab,"Had it an hour before deciding to purchase the app. Great way to manage my specific workout schedule as well as other daily habits and tasks. Took me some time to figure out how to organize everything best for me because my workout plan changes. For example, I want to burn 1200 or more calories a day, sometimes more, so I set the habit at least 1200 and can enter actual burned calories. It calculates for the goal duration how many total I burned. Love this app!!",5

I would love to have a visual of my progress in each habit for the past week, but that is the only recommendation I can make. Overall this app is perfect!",5

Also it will be easier to use (rather than keep on backing up) if there is a log in option, in case the phone got broken. I give 5 stars for the super responsive customer support. Love it!",5
