213117c9-925b-44ab-bb2b-b243ba1c48f5,I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.,3
bbd8b626-af33-4b61-b006-ed97d4b9a2c0,"Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.",3
e6050f75-89a7-42cc-949d-c2530337a5d6,I can't arrange my habits in the order I want. I have to choose from preselected options like alphabetical.,3
618e6ccd-73db-46a4-a0bf-c23285f18cd1,Good but the free options weren't too much.,3

80a9450b-4b60-41b8-ba28-5c4ca3618e69,It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.,3
95460e68-0752-40e7-bb38-6c36703ec4cd,I have enough credit but I can't purchase for premium,3
41e63567-16d3-419a-a3a3-95bba817bde4,I don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so I am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app,3
1c91f196-fe69-4609-9539-49aaecdb9354,"Seems like it could have been great for me. However, lack of ability to modify repeating schedule (e.g. which days of the week) is a blocker. Switched to HabitHub for now.",3
f6217c37-0360-4f90-9f0d-75ed2977278c,"It's very useful so far, however I'm not sure if you can change your daily routine. I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",3
bf0f8a30-4f16-40b8-a6c3-cfc527b111ac,Can't set times for when tasks need to be completed. Can't tick off tasks for the next day,3
14403bd2-74da-42a4-9893-ad5ea65c1db9,Dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app. Otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive.,3
03da5192-b3d1-4f6f-8230-7a271e6aa335,Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,3
ec54961c-993a-4f14-9f3a-d13310912ef7,"UI needs major improvements. The only app I believe which give quantitative habits also (not just binary) like 4 pages to read. Statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea. This is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version, so keeping it. else due to UI would have rejected long time back. Current apps in market give 3 or 5 max.",3
cc6ff47c-7b27-49f8-ad0b-9097b20bfde6,I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,3
c2cc34b1-4fa5-4446-bbe2-61938cabf26f,ok,3
d8c67ea7-01f6-4ed1-be94-4cca2621ee0b,"Decent. Simple. Just a bit too simple for me. I thought the percentages counted for task progress S though it were a whole project. Unfortunately, it seems to only relate to habits. I'd like to see subtasks and then percentage competed. At least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing.",3
