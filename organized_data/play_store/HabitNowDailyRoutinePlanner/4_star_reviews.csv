78abeae1-3ea1-4644-98a0-502773208dda,"This app is so flexible and has so many features, it's really helpful all across the board. Though some feedback, is it possible to let Notes/Descriptions be optionally displayed in the day/task lists? It would help to clarify some details with a one or multi line display. And a progress bar/percent of checklist completion. And custom date format like DD.MM.YY instead of MM.DD.YY. and setting reminders as ""days before"" to more custom periods like hours before, for example",4

In the ""Today"" section: upcoming, next 7 days tasks, habits can be displayed. 2. Multiple calendar views. Can be something like weekly, monthly, timeline views 3. Categories should show the entries within that category and not just the edit page for categories. Essentially the filter view but for categories tab.",4

a6de32da-8c6e-4dc5-9ae9-ea3280611a13,Nice app. Could be improved : - add habits from widget - reorder habits in the list - graphs and synthetic and not per task monthly/yearly view - show rating given for task in the list view without having to tap on it,4
3f806fc7-1dff-481b-a353-3f0b39616d50,It is a helpful tool to stay on habits and reminders for task/appts. I love that you can see how consistent you've been with your habits as well. Very detailed app,4
8e8b649b-a749-4d5f-b280-1e18cb816f23,"The app is great and I just use it to track habits and see my improvement overtime. I like that you can choose to say ""x"" to habits once youve failed them (for example an ""avoid sugar"" habit can be marked as an X immediately after I've failed it rather than it showing up as an uncompleted habit). Premium is a one time low fee so I can mark off tasks with the widget. I wish it didn't say habit under each of my habits bc it just takes up space in the widget that can be used to show more habits",4

Needs a means of viewing progress for all habits together, perhaps a graph. Also needs the ability to change how many ticks count as a success without having to delete and start again so progress can evolve. Adding a note section to a day rather than a habit would be useful for significant events can either interrupt or influence habits.",4

Personally the premium app is worth it but still plenty of goodies in the free one if hou only want 5 habits. Lots of customisation great colours - really motivates you,4

208dfd8a-0697-4304-9e07-24f26cc2ef9f,"Edit: I really love this app. I really think having the ability to graph the habits is needed for it to be the best Habit tracking app. Please do seriously consider it. Even if it's in premium only, I'd pay for that. CSV export (premium only) is fine to then turn into a graph, but it defeats the point of convenience to encourage habits. Thanks.",4

I'm not 100% on it all the time but it is nice to be able to have recurring tasks and habits and not have to manually track this stuff myself.,4

62e75a88-b514-48ff-a96a-01ef6231b4f9,On the today section beside the reminder time for every habit you should include the percentage completion aswell. Often times I don't remember to press on the habit section and I have noticed recently that I am not completing my habits consistently as I'm not checking completion percentage daily and being aware of my progress. For single one time tasks I would like the option to add a timer so that I feel motivated to them. I often set due dates for these tasks but never do them.,4

Second, if you could make all habit in the day it should be marked as perfect days on calendar, and also day streak about how far we have maintain doing all of our habits without fails will also encourage us further, please add all of these feature",4

Success is if you count the action equal or less times per day to your goal. It could be set up like the check list feature, touching the day for that habit opens a box with the counter.

Keep up the good work Edit - Bought the premium version. Suggestion - - Add swipe at home screen to change date - Also a button for 'today' if we move to a different date in next week or next month. So that we can easily navigate back to current date,4

My suggestion: I would like to be able to connect habbits together, so they can work as anchor habbits. For example after I brush my teeth (habbit 1) I want to make my bed (Habbit 2) so for making my bed brushing my teeth works as a anchor habbit. in the app it could look like 1 big habbit with no visual boarder, they would still have seperate Checkboxes though.",4

Everything you need in a habit app. The user interface is modern and easy to use and the statistics in depth with many options for tailoring and tracking your habits.

For example, having a visual clock to show you that by this and this time you need to get xyz done. You can already put habits and tasks into categories which is great!",4

A few criticisms: 1. recurring tasks not completed should move to the next day. 2. It should be an option to complete a habit on a different day to make up for the day missed. Ex, If I miss a workout on Tues, I can make it up Wed & have my tracker stay accurate. 3. You should be able to swipe left or right on the home screen to move between days.",4

In my opinion, I have only two suggestions: The first is ""snooze"" function for notification or alarm could be muted and contain vibration mode(sometimes people are too busy to finish the habit and they want to postpone, but using arlam are quite annoyed because of sounds). The second is an overview statistic board for all habits, I think it would be great to see all the results in one board. Anyway, I love this app",4

The UI is intuitive and easy to set up and has a lot of options for habit frequency and targets. I like that you can set a full time period, including the start date, for the habit. My old tracker just had a target end date. Glad the option to sort the habits manually is coming (or at least that is alluded to on several previous responses to reviews). That would be a good improvement to the UI. I do wish there were a way to synch data across devices, however. The cloud backup option may work for that, but I think it could be simplified using the linked account data. There is also not a ""sync on start up/close"" or ""daily"" option for that, so I'd regularly be getting stale data on the second device upon upload of the backup.",4

Edititng days that you've forgotten to track is easy to do in the 'today view' and in the calendar view of each habit, and it clearly shows hard fails for everyday habits, and soft fails for habits that only need to be completed so many times a week. Plus, the statistics screen is a clear and informative overview of how you're doing with each habit. I'm leaving off a star purely for the fact that I think units could be implemented better. Currently you can set a number of units to be completed a number of times per week or month (which is great for glasses of water, or press-ups etc). But what I think would be useful is to also be able to track units cumulatively over a week or month.

If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits.

2a21b967-eabb-4ba0-8546-ef33d8c6ce22,Not bad at all good to track habits,4
8990ff3f-d2aa-4e1d-8f86-11528b2faefb,Very good to build up discipline. I think this may be very good if the application can change the frequency/schedule after the habits are created because sometime the habit need to be observed and schedule can change until the user find his proper schedule.,4

af1d1490-2ef1-416a-bdac-ab26c54a4b9a,Une bonne appli qui m'aide à m'organiser. J'aime pouvoir mettre à la fois des tâches de routin et des objectifs.,4
16aeb8a2-b201-4139-a40e-b78e1f5ad6d2,"VERY GOOD and far better than most of the similar apps that I have tried so far. It would be great if weekly schedule could be added for an specific habit, so you could be reminded at different times during different days of the week; which sounds more functional and reasonable as we usually don't have a fixed routine during the week. Needless to say what a big improvement a companion smart watch app would be!",4

4350f54e-4d98-44ce-a1aa-00d9130ad98a,HabitNow is a great app. Well thought out and the colours are good! No dark mode in free version but I don't see that as a reason to give less than 5 stars. Has helped me to organise aspects of my life.,4

b4b6067e-d582-46d7-92b2-53ba55adc812,"I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this",4
869b5757-e0b2-4e85-933c-477376e7f23e,Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,4
2bbc1b72-8caa-4b94-8892-0c9c029b3693,Add checklist and a web companion. Please,4
6a5d925b-7200-4aec-aed0-023bbb6f2899,"Great app for habit tracking, I purchased the premium upgrade because I liked it so much. Support is very responsive too. Hello please add ability to swipe thru habit charts between each habit! I want to view information as quickly and easily as possible so I can get feedback fast and go on with the day. Tapping thru menus back and forth is too many extra steps for no reason other than coding. It's a little frustrating perhaps I should have more patience but it will make your app more usable.",4

ec4a0554-dbea-413c-afc5-dbdcb5700eb8,"Two requests please: 1) Allow the user to set what time the day/recurrent tasks reset. Not everyone's ""day"" ends at midnight! 2) Propagate the theme selected to the widget. If I have selected a dark blue theme, my widget should have the same dark blue icon(s), not a bright red HabitNow one. Good so far, more customization would make it great...thanks!",4

If am making habit of reading a book , i can click a pic of that book and add to its icon in order to differentiate. And second thing please guide me to make a notes for my monthly or weekly target of all subjects. Does note making have adding some pics or not ?? I don't know, but that will be of much help. Please guide me to make monthly or weekly notes . Thanks in advance.",4
ab4aab5c-75e4-4522-83be-8a010ba258df,Dobar Dan. Good app you have here and worth the small charge. Reliable alarm. HabitNow can help change your life for better by reminding you to stay on track of your plans. Useful app in a cyberspace of useless apps.,4

e837ffba-76f1-4b8d-897a-2bba636b207a,"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)...

8fc3d2b5-0473-4d5e-bd48-aed98beb61c9,"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",4

c3a0c104-0f16-4696-a110-a4961eb82687,So far I am loving this app bc it has my to-do list but I can also add habits I want to start doing and keep track of. I haven't got the premium version yet and I still can do so much. Hoping one day to maybe get the premium version.,4

a26082b4-67fe-481d-baa8-61e423a28ad3,This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,4
72acfaef-9f10-4581-9b55-bbaf7ce0a1ce,this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,4

77c7b83f-5ea8-434d-81fa-f9cfda960ee2,I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,4
ada2f9d7-f33b-4f6e-a5c1-5ef5412d6e16,"Been using it for some weeks, it's simple but useful. Great to keep track of your daily tasks or to avoid forgeting something, not as invasive as the alarm clock and more eficcent then a memo. Well done.",4
