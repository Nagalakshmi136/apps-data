c8762417-e51c-4979-852f-56945896f102,"I love this app, but the subscription model holds me back. I would have gladly paid a one-time premium fee, but the recurring monthly/annual costs are a bit steep for my budget as a student..:( If the developers considered offering a lifetime purchase option at a lower price point, I would have already upgraded to premium. Despite this, the app's features and functionality are impressive.",4
f9fd1358-a5b1-4315-86cb-a2c50b012e8a,"You had a wonderful app before the last 2 upgrades, now I'm looking for a replacement. For example, I use notes in the To-Do (i put there exactly the steps i needed to do), and if before I would just click the To-Do item and I would see all notes, now I have to click the item, click Sttings, scroll to notes and then click it so I can see them.",4
c6fc2158-c008-4a44-839a-18807e806f77,"A lot of fun using the AI dream creator to create goals based on different dreams. The app is nice and neat and lets you easily see your goals associated with your different dreams while not looking overwhelming. It's a great option for working toward your goals, especially if you value ad-free apps and don't have money to spend on things like apps.:thumbs_up: That said, always support and get premium if you find value and it's within your means. These people work hard to make these things free for us.",4

But I have an idea for making a new thing. I guess a reminder or a warn when you are making a new habit/task is so nice. I mean, for example, I write a habit for 6 pm on Friday, and then I write another habit for 6 pm on Friday on another task. Here, if it is a little warn, that would be only a reminder. It would be very nice",4

The only thing that I would suggest is the 'widget option'. I realise that it has been recently added, but it's a little cluttered. I would like if there were separte sections for each separate dream (and tasks) which would make the UI a lot more appealing, plus, it would be easy to navigate each dream separately; directly from the widget on screen. :)",4

Maybe try doing a subscription plan for people to have unlimited 1 tap goals? But anyways really good! Would recommend it,4
2166f546-26b7-41ce-8d58-9aee98b25d8c,"It is a great app. Beautiful UI and with many features. Would be great if it had widgets for the habits and the option to enable reminders for tasks and habits more than once a day, because it's really easy to forget things, even with a motivational message in the beginning of the day and one at night. But is a great app that could be even better!!!",4
c2d2d432-a8cc-4be3-afdd-5850d3f52597,"I have only just gotten started, but it's a beautiful app in my preferred aesthetic that has a wonderful concept of helping your dreams - both small and big come true. It helps you get started with some common dreams we have. It doesn't seem to pressure you with too many specific steps either. And, at the very least, just having a list of what you want to achieve that's in line with your true goals is an incredibly helpful reminder in your daily life so that you'll be more likely to achieve them",4

af7b0120-d843-4761-bcd5-938244e7e8e4,it's a little confusing but once you get the hang of it it's so good it really helps me out,4
fe908c35-d197-4433-bddb-7cfa65b1ca87,"I really love the idea and style of this app. Thank you for creating it. It makes me easier when following my goal to be a morning person and I'm still using to make my goal come true. However, I have to eliminate 1 star cause everytime I am back in, the app always reset my daily habits and I have to tick it again. Besides, just a small error that yesterday I finished all my habits but today it said I only finished 7/11. Not much but a little disappointed for me so it's nice if you can fix it",4
27e457f8-f0aa-4c79-b170-3313d466e166,"Love the idea and simplicity of it, won't use until it has dark mode",4
2417a89e-4162-4223-ae0b-e511d14b8a1b,"I love the fact that it is all free. Usually developers will ask for your credit card details at this quality of goal-oriented app. And also the goal plan :star-struck::star-struck::star-struck: this app helps me gain motivation to be an entrepreneur again. A healthy, smart and confident one :hundred_points: Keep this up :flexed_biceps_light_skin_tone: This app will help millions of people become successful in no time. :hundred_points::hundred_points: My only suggestion is to add more goal plans.",4
5e0a3636-f160-48b9-8b34-ca9697f43616,"I love this app, it is great for setting your goals, habits and it does what it needs to do. It helps me motivate myself to do my tasks and it is overall a great app, but I will put 5 stars when they let you make your own tasks and habits and when there will be more task space. At the moment I can only put a limited amount of tasks and a lot of the tasks that I need to do are not there. Overall a great app and would recommend this to everyone.",4
309d5e88-f51f-451c-94a8-d673f83737a2,I really like it. I only wish it had a widget.,4
83708ba9-da8f-4adb-9105-4f188af939b0,"Love the app, its amazing, the only thing that I want to be added to the app is the options to set specific times (hours, minutes etc. ) to do things In the habit section",4
a9ace2f7-ebbf-4fb2-b6d9-399670b27614,The app is great! Although it would be nice if I could add monthly habits and ones that repeat every number of days (like every 3 days....),4
55917666-9b6a-4265-b1f8-b48f25269c66,"I want this to become my personal planner also. Hopefully, it will add time slots for habits that I do in the future updates. I am giving a 5-star rate because it satisfies me and my taste. Please consider my suggestion, I really want to stick to this app. More power!",4
626e6a95-71d8-4076-b5f8-bfd544e1ac76,The app is wonderful and really loved it. But from time to time it keeps telling me to sign in again and I already had. I Hope you fix that soon.,4
8459e936-e8c2-4574-877f-14eebe6a6c6f,I really like this app. I like the colours and the simplicity. I also like that it reminds me of my goals in life and the things I want to do to reach them. However I think it would be better if we could have more than one goal (or dream) for a habit. Some habits help you reach more than one goal. Also I signed up with my Google account and now I can't change my name or my photo in the settings. I hope you'll consider these in the future updates. Thank you! ^-^,4
c17dc89f-2cda-48ad-95a5-aa7738488e62,It was really nice to push myself to be a little better everyday!,4
394e4e11-6b6a-48c9-b7ae-4331cef0b603,I really like that this app has a pre-plan goal for you. I would like to give a 5 star if it has time reminder but over all I would highly recommebd this app,4
