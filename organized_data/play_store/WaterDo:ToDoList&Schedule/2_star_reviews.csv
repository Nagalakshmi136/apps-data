f8d6c6a4-411a-4121-be66-8fbcade5ee7a,It's really annoying that theor web app doesn't actually let you add tasks so it's pretty useless for anyone who wants an app that is cross platform despite how cute everything is,2
fb0d4cfe-54ee-4210-afaf-534cec317d0c,For repetition I have to buy premi7. When they can show me an add and let me do it but they won't.,2
72328e36-218d-4b7e-8000-e076a1fc24e1,UI is poor,2
f7b4e8c9-69be-4caa-9623-b5f440ae1a56,"Would be good except reordering tasks is very buggy, making the app unsuable.",2
c683d919-ca9b-42d5-834f-6e4214f5448e,I'm probably and idiot but I couldn't work out how to actually create a task. I created on and hit the arrow but it didn't show up anywhere. I gave up and have deleted app!,2
420a6897-15cf-42e2-acda-c7d5be94b989,"Too good, seriously",2
13784b5f-7b7b-4820-9b1d-2b95168d56e6,Much better apps available at less or no pricing.,2
46c5f8d7-bf30-4c59-8bfb-53cc0010b082,The font size in the bubbles is too small & not adjustable. I would like completed bubbles to show in some quick view.,2
48a2cf42-25e0-4ee8-b25f-192fe5432d8f,"I love the Forest app, but this one is meh. Progress is slow, you have to wait 10h to open a trunk and now I have to pay to upgrade one of my island components to the max?! It 's nice because of how easy it is to use, but it's not satisfying",2
a9b95315-6fa2-44fc-916a-da8bbd363692,"I can't make tasks other than the tutorial one. And I can't pop it satisfyingly, only through the menu",2
f3694dae-6c1c-4479-9d7b-6bf2863053df,App was confusing in it's layout. Didn't provide clear instructions on how to write/configure tasks. I was hoping for variety on how I wrote tasks so I could leave different notes for repeat tasks per day but it was always the same. Might be useful as a reminder tool for tasks only but for a tasks/journal didn't work so well. Primarily because the layout isn't intuitive to learn and more built around display rather than function.,2
41355d9c-b798-4ebe-b1ad-4af9d8863457,"I was expecting a lot more from seekrtech, given they had forest. But, there are definitely better apps out there. This had a good concept, but progression was too slow and unsatisfying. Their daily review system was a good idea, but the restricted time frame was dumb and inflexible. I also had a lot of issues with bugs and weird things happening over the day reset. In all, this app is a good idea, but executed not well enough to the industry standard",2
24cd1b2b-f05b-445b-8b38-c0f4fa2b21a7,No dark mode is just an immediate turn off for me.,2
0bb3fb97-06a3-4da2-9047-fdcc57d9e180,"Okay. 2 stars due to needing to have an Internet connection to use. Even with paying for the premium service, the app won't open unless you have a stable Internet connection.",2
a1d3ec55-27bc-481c-87a9-5a796fd38f2b,"This app was fantastic for me, but now it crashes multiple times a day and it doesn't let me add new tasks. It's very frustrating",2
c013be93-ab2b-4e3e-aad5-dca09dc3ae8a,"All of the tasks that I set to repeat daily are duplicated on the same day up to 3 or 4 times. Your task description can’t be longer than 33 characters otherwise it won’t fit inside the bubble & you’ll need to enter edit mode inorder to see the whole task. The website for PCs has the same issue, the text boxes are too small & don’t expand to allow for a second line of text. You'll need to tap into edit mode to see the checklist for any task. The web app keeps logging me out & it’s very slow. ETC",2
54729681-6c9c-4e47-b6c6-c15ee29bf735,Too much price,2
cd49d68a-fe55-4c9a-8072-86a1ee7384bf,At least you should make some of the Islands free. More than 10 islands are locked it would be a shame to do that.,2
0f681ad7-4e37-4503-8287-6b7ef8f07559,The idea is nice however it is causing inconvenience on my device. It stops responding after a few minutes of usage and sometimes even freezes my phone.,2
2a7b8318-62de-47ce-b761-8319f0d5bcb2,"I have had this app for a while now & it was good for some time. Now I have gone through almost all the islands & it feels like there's nothing more to make it feel fun. Unfortunately, there haven't been updated for a long time now. You can't access the app if you aren't connected to the internet & even when you are it shows that there is no connection at times.",2
9e7aab3f-ede7-4f7d-8517-7709aa1a70c2,"It was a really good app 3 years ago, now it has lost its purpose. Where are the task bubbles that you can pop located?",2
ede3d74f-fe0a-41a5-9b6b-aea6e06c335c,"I really want to like this app but ever since I completed the first island, the island UI keeps freezing and causing the app to become unusable until I force close and reopen the app. Sort of ruins the whole shtick of what could make this app unique.",2
6350206c-6bbc-44ad-bc71-fd3c03d3ca95,"Em alguns momentos o toque para de funcionar, tô tentando comprar um vila nova e não consigo, pq ele não funciona o touch-screen, só tem como voltar, fazendo o gesto pelo próprio celular",2
a9850071-376d-4223-9f50-4092478e2abc,"пока не осовилась, но приложение крутое. когда сделаете виджет, будет вообще замечательно. а ещё было гораздо удобнее с регуляцией размеров кружка, тк текст попросту не влезает + все выглядит одинаково и глаз не цепляется",2
4543b8bf-8c34-44b9-8047-75cfb01bf918,"I dislike how it has you set up an account before you can find any where about how much a membership is ($1 a month, or $15 for lifetime). On top of that, I had to dig thru reviews to find out anyways because the app doesn't work for me. I only get a hamburger menu and white screens. I uninstalled.",2
f540791c-6fc4-4edf-9edf-bf8d150739ad,Not many options without paying,2
c06acfcb-1c99-4bee-a379-4040230d4740,"I'd ever used it in a month on 2019, then I uninstalled it, yesterday I tried to install again with forest and sleep town..... Forest and sleep town run well, but this app only appear white screen",2
129ab47a-73ac-418b-bad1-fcc99dfe0b24,"I normally love this app, so the fact I have to write this review is very frustrating! It seems like since the last update, 1/2 of my tasks aren't being counted as completed once I ""pop"" them as done. I'll have to make a couple fake tasks and pop them until one of them counts. I don't know why the app is doing this. I've restarted my phone, cleared the app's cache, and redownloaded the app, but nothing has changed. It's frustrating to have an app I love so much lose one of it's best parts!",2
28e69489-4046-448b-938b-4c85f3761fc5,"The app was great until it stopped and started being a cashgrab only. ""Subscribe to do anything"" deleted it. Can't add tasks as that's the POINT of the app but apparently you have to be subscribed.",2
4742f78f-3c55-4670-a1f8-52b377c0e8ed,"I loved it but it was really buggy. Froze a lot. I can't justify paying money for something that crashes all the time. Such a shame, I really got things done and loved the daily review.",2
8b8ec73b-d959-4c4e-9861-5e8f89c34b81,"I got a new phone, and all prior instances of my recurring tasks were suddenly undone and overdue—that's thousands of tasks. I told them about it, but only got a ""we'll deal with it someday""-type message. I stopped using it after not hearing back for a few months, despite paying for lifetime premium. Also, selecting ""no music"" still led to hearing the completed tasks jingle every time.",2
079905bb-6a25-42ac-9fe4-fd6d6cbb567c,If there is no premium this could be the best app which I have seen It deserves 2 stars for its premium price,2
85040b73-4ced-4e4b-bccf-d1725c75fec7,Basically this app lacks user experience. It is missing a lot of feature like keeping the record of uncompleted tasks. The only fun part is popping bubbles. I've paid for premium lifetime pack. I'm expecting a lot more in future,2
c6b14449-b286-4f7c-9bf1-f86ea2daa056,"Nice layout but basic function. No hyperlink for phone number or email, limited readable text into the field. Investment not worthy",2
c8c1fd0c-0e84-488a-a0c3-6dbc4f83d703,"Well, I'll never know. I downloaded a few to do apps at the same time, to compare. Probably opened this and looked at the intro, but I don't know for sure sure as I can't see it again to remind myself. Today it just tells me I can't use it without restoring my purchase. I didn't sign up for the free trial and definitely didn't subscribe,, so the trial period must have started when I first opened the app. Shame as it looked promising but this experience doesn't entice me to try again.",2
f7f5aea4-afb7-45a9-a94d-5ed933ee3349,It's technically functional but it's very frustrating to have it constantly say I'm offline when I'm online. To do lists are supposed to help with stress but having a chest I can't open because it keeps claiming I'm offline is irritating.,2
540e5333-e4c2-4a89-9ebc-067618484dca,Trying to sign up on an android device. Boxes open requiring answers but only part of the box shows on my screen so I cannot select anything or close the box.,2
36ad38b1-25f3-4697-bdad-3e5670d72a62,"It was an amazing app but after 3-4 weeks when I click 'Add a task' or some button on it, It shows the Vip thing like- the premium one so I cannot add a task or do anything on the app please fix this I really loved this app also just so you know I'm using an android phone so please fix this...",2
f9f01925-16e4-4fcb-bdc0-a479b980a265,You need to purchase before use . Me as a student didn't have a lot of money up to 60 RM MYR per month,2
b261f50e-d2ba-4a12-a4fa-f0b29fb75f24,It's a good app I would have gave it 5 stars but it's just hanging toooooo much it not adding my tasks in the list instead it's bringing me back to my home page. I have reinstalled atleast 5 times today. It's just so upsetting.,2
5fa0c3a0-831a-4e38-8b0d-61165f30cf98,"I used the app during the trial period, there are some nice options there so I went on even though there were bugs and some of the functionality is not so relevant to managing tasks... Overall was nice. Unfortunately, once the trial period was over, they simply *blocked* access to all my data!!! Had some important tasks there and I have no way to see it now! If I was thinking about purchasing the app in the future, there's no way that's going to happen after this.",2
ec575be7-a8a7-4ae2-b439-0659cad5e2de,Nice idea but adding tasks is laggy / not smooth. The swipe to bring up the add task bar is v laggy and ruins the ux,2
b2ad6ba9-d2e6-47f3-87d3-e33a1bd2c7d9,"The app itself is actually pretty good, but I am experiencing a lot of software incompatibilities. I have an Android 11 and it keeps detecting issue from the app and basically the phone turns off every once in a while since I have installed the app, to the point that I had to disinstall it otherwise I could not use my phone. Is there any way we can sort that out? I even purchased the 1 year option that atm I can in no way use on my smartphone. Thank you in advance. It'd had been a great app",2
4a7607a9-2464-4f8b-975f-6750086f6922,Aww :( I feel like I would have loved it if there was a free version. I would have preferred a free one with ads than only a paid option even if there is a seven day trial.,2
c118804a-4120-4905-959e-27b354b1d60e,"I am disappointed that you don't allow a daily review after midnight. Likewise, some of ""today's"" tasks might get finished after midnight, but your software doesn't account for this fact. You should allow for more flexibility because not everyone has the same schedule in this era of electric light and convenience shopping.",2
b331b603-d012-418b-8fcf-8058d7c2fbe8,I also can't get passed through the trial stage of the app,2
32c814aa-63b7-4061-bf01-f20e07de148e,"When i downloaded this I was so exited. But you have to pay just to do the basic. It seems like such a good idea, but way more people would download it if it had a free option.",2
994f26c6-f2f8-40e0-8dea-1fadcf0b4bfe,"I like the concept, but without Google Calendar integration and a desktop version to make initial entering and daily review of tasks easier, this is useless. I also would like to be able to categorize tasks and have those bubbles be different colors. I currently use and love GQueues. Unless you can compete with their features, I'm not going to pay for this app.",2
2a624dde-ab71-4468-a9cd-276a2b1c404e,Expensive,2
3fce3c1d-0344-46bf-9602-c2e6a4662ffc,Very expensive ! And not even a trial period to know how it works !,2
f40bffed-6229-4c01-969e-a88c4dca093a,"Must agree with others, ""free"" to install is deceptive. I would have no problem paying a low amount from the start, or pay for additional options as i have done gladly for forest and sleeptown. But 15€ is a lot for a to-do list app, and it does nothing if you don't pay. Please adjust that. Also i was only able to popp the tutorial bubble, all other Bubbles only lead me to their menu when i tap them. So no satisfaction there. Great idea, but not for that pricing.",2
a1251575-6c0a-4ea0-ba61-4f7c405c368e,"Could have taken a better approach. I have no issue with paid apps, and I do like the option of a life time subscription. But since under other people's review you said it's a paid app, why don't you just make it a paid app on playstore, instead of free to download? It feels deceptive plus you can't see any feature of the app, making me not wanting to pay.",2
35efdd5e-77e8-4156-90b5-69a00ece4e33,Claims to be a free app but won't let me do anything without playing unreasonably high prices for a subscription.,2
2d64f2ae-fe1f-4d8a-867b-d0c8ea2165c1,"Feels a bit deceptive to require you to provide payment information so it can set you up to autopay after the free trial, without letting you actually see how the app works. It was a waste of time for me to download it. I'll gladly pay for apps once I try them, but I hate the whole gotcha-by-autopay setup. A shame since it looks like a nice idea but I won't be able to see how the interface works.",2

7efbafaa-b4bf-49dc-a5f8-4bdfb24ce670,"Has potential to be a good app, but I am finding way to many errors. Would be worth the 99 cents if it did not have as many bugs. The screen freezes upon buying characters, and restoring bubbles.",2
847a9008-d4bd-4513-a2cf-3466451c308b,Really not a fan of the 6 ball upper limit. I also just find this concept so much less engaging than something actually based around nature,2
242f550e-82bd-41cf-847b-b64e8b4d0661,"Hey I was excited to use the app but it's really a bummer that you only get rewarded for 6 balls a day.... It should really be up to the person whether they're going to be productive or not, and the limit is only going to make people unhappy. Could you fix this issue please?",2
