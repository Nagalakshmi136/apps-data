This app is buggier, and I find some of the things put behind the pay wall to be annoying. You can sort tasks into colors so you can see on a graph what you have been completing but they want you to pay if you want more than 3 colors.

The app is great, I like it. I think what's locked behind premium is absurd, and the price is way too high to use this app to it's fullest potential, but it's actually a good checklist app, so I recommend trying it out. I will buy premium Eventually. After a long time. It's not that great.",3

I'm not a fan of the subscription model, and to buy permanently is not something I can currently justify at the price they're asking. The price for the year is closer to something I'd be willing to pay to keep it permanently. Notes for improvements (that I can think of): -Be able to open chests more often (say every 5-7 hours) -More colours for bubbles like pink and purple -More islands over time, so we don't run out.",3

Okay app ig but make it free and add a premium but don't take away the concept+the island needs to be more fun and not bland and boring because I didn't care abt it",3

8f61c6bf-f461-4b0e-ae66-1a630a936b89,"What the devs can improve on is adding a trashbin, so for all the task that gets deleted will be in a temporary trashbins and will get permanently removed after certain days to mitigate accident task deletion. Other than that, let us adjust wheres the bubble at by holding the bubble, often times the bubble is on top of other bubble which is annoying",3

d1df4446-9501-452b-8613-acf1792e71d8,"It's understandable that it's not free, but it's a little cheap to hide that inside the app so that you have to download it in order to find that out. Instead of the list price here on the app store it just says in app purchases.

Both of those work wonderfully for me, but so far WaterDo has not; everytime I try to create a task, it disappears. Furthermore, I'm asking the developers to please offer a lifetime subscription option (just like their other apps); I prefer this much more than renewing subscriptions! Edit: both issues have been fixed! Very happy with the app now :)",3

Especially since you need to pop a lot (too much if you ask me) of water bubbles to unlock things on your island. It becomes quite tedious if you constantly have to type all those smaller tasks into your phone in order to unlock stuff.. if you ask me. I like to concept, I really do, but I feel like it is still missing some essential features (like a desktop version or more/easier/quicker 'story progression')",3

I hope you have a desktop version where you can use your PC to enlist your tasks and it'll automatically sync with your phone (Like Notion). I am also hoping for different UI color modes, like dark/light mode because the app currently feels too limited and stiff.",3

At the very least, basic controls like that should be added into the tutorials. I eventually figured it out by experimenting but the process of not having it do what you expect was slightly frustrating esp for an app that's supposed to make you feel good about completing things.",3

You could make the user press a ""pop bubble button"" and then when the users come back to the bubble screen, the bubble of the task they marked complete will be glowing, and ll pop when pressed 2s.",3
