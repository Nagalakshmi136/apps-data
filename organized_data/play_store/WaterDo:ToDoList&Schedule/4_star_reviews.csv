ac95b166-af0f-459f-92a6-6ac0fcec1545,"so far it looks great, but i really wish i could add emojis to my task titles. the organization is really clean though, and it's gameified in a way that feels unobtrusive but satisfying. One thing i wish it had is a setting to control how many tasks until you get a key. I use it to keep track of everything I need to do daily (shower, eat, etc) and since I have about 15 tasks every day, I'm constantly overloaded with keys. But it doesn't really impact my experience or enjoyment.",4

5b35cb6e-6649-400e-95b7-b54fc3096776,A cute little app that helps keep yourself accountable. I used this to keep track of deadlines or personal notes and I was very satisfied with the reminders and rewards given when you cross something off of your to-do list or burst a bubble in this case;⁠) Overall I like this app even if there is always room for improvement.,4

This app feels just right, although I wish there were more flexible options I like that is simple and cute. Dev reached out, you double tap to pop ballooons.. edit: thanks for helping me enjoy this app more. Id like to add that I also bought the app and it is even better with everything open.

8eca3efa-b0b2-4a6d-a622-7d39bb57f77a,"I've had an overall positive experience with WaterDo! I like the option to color-code tasks and the sounds you've chosen for accomplishing a task or completing one are *chef's kiss* for my neurodivergent brain! However, I'm frequently glazing over the app when I should be using it more often. Is there a widget I could use for it, please? If that were possible, I'd be willing to change my rating to 5 :star:.",4

Now I've used this app for a while, and despite all the updates, it still runs a little too slow to gameify my to-do's. Loading treasure boxes and islands takes a while! I also don't know what I'm supposed to do as I accumulate keys but can only open a box every 10 hours, but maybe I'm not understanding the point.

b54ccfa1-b810-4988-88d8-df987232fcf5,Am in trail period but already loving it. Few things are stopping frm buying it 1)The widget lack substance and it can be polished way better than now.2)I don't understand why we've to use internet even after paying the app.I wish I can use this app offline completely.3)No dark mode.4)The price is little bit higher and there's no spec offer on lifetime for forest pro users.5)I don't understand the use of diamonds.But thank you so much for the app.Hope these features are taken into consideration,4
c63d1817-154e-4565-8380-a40472c56038,Waterdo is a great to do list its basically u popping virtual water bubbles (the water bubbles are the things you have to do) and saving actual water for poor people it gives u a starters pack I payed for it but its a very small amount,4
30257169-443d-4d22-b93c-6bf49ce59909,"Nice app but the there can be more things that can be done to make it more attractive and compelling the person to do task in order to gain parts or instrument, construction items. Also you can make a feature where these bubbles can float on our mobile screen so that we can always know that we need to get these things done",4

995bf7c7-9210-4bcc-9eef-15695d9c0306,"Great to-do list app, but removed one star because the app automatically resets daily recurring tasks at midnight. For people who sleep late, this is irritating -- at 1am I'm still up and don't want to reset my to do list yet. It would be great if there were a setting to delay when the daily tasks refresh (e.g. like the Anki flashcard app, where you can specify the time of night when daily flashcards will reset).",4

6a5ab21e-815a-4de5-a8d7-73fb582e165a,It's a good app for keeping track of my to do list..... but I think you can work on your widget a little I mean it takes a little too much of space so if you could make it a little smaller :grinning_face_with_sweat:,4
84da3aaa-1042-455b-8e15-bf33e445a010,I like that the daily list is broken into small collections of bubbles to pop and that you can adjust the order of importance for tasks. I also like that you can have both regularly scheduled recurring tasks and singles tasks in your list.,4

efe319cd-60f2-4176-aa0b-5c8afb52ec03,"I love the app. It makes me a lot more productive. But one thing that I hope you add in the future is: the checklist inside a task being more interative, for example, being able to follow how many steps of that task I concluded (like 2/7 view on the bubble), and maybe even the buble changing in some way, like, being colored or something as we evolve in the task (as the previous example, bubble would be only 2/7 parts colored, but we can complete the task even it it's not fully colored)",4

It's also a lot cheaper than all the other ADD apps out there. My only change is when doing the daily review. I wish there was a button that says hey I did this but I forgot to mark it off. Plus when you have something scheduled for every Monday and you have a busy Monday and you wi do it on Tuesday instead. It changes the date to every Tuesday.,4

Too often to-do list like this focus too much on one or the other but this is the perfect balance.

Firstly, you should be able to pick a time for daily reviews. I like to do them when I first wake up, but I also wake up around 11, and the cut off time for morning reviews is 12. Second, the history isn't very helpful, it really should be a list day by day because sometimes I want to remind myself what I've done so that I have motivation to keep going.",4

It works so well because it's super satisfying to pop those bubbles & receive chests to unlock things on the little islands. But one major feature that is lacking is dark mode, especially for those who paid for the app. White screens hurt my eyes, so I'm hoping the devs release dark mode very soon. Thank you!",4

The very light design is hard on light sensitive eyes. -The need to almost constantly be online and the long wait time for the daily review and treasure chests to load is quite annoying. -Still would like to see some sort of ""flex"" task feature too.

Only complaints/requests I have are: A) More colours for tags, as all the blues look quite similar; B) Ability to prioritise tasks, with higher priority tasks having bigger bubbles. Other than that, great little app and a neat companion to Forest and SleepTown!",4
1806982e-9a4c-4471-a6f1-a614df564aa3,Would love it more if you could add a time allotment feature for every task. That way the possibility of the task being done would increase. Right now it's just the list of things on your phone scheduled day wise. Anyways..good work.,4
d19b87e0-636c-428f-a411-02184ac6c86c,Super nice and useful and everything but i would really love a dark mode and a dark mode evem for the widget plz and also i would love more colors for the bubbles each bubble with a different color .. well i love it as it is now but i would prefer some more stuff like this i mentioned .. and thank u :red_heart:,4
aee08513-0535-4b00-b601-4a12a9155b59,"It would really really cool, if you add something like shopping list that is not tied to the tasks, so we won't need switch to another app for that. And maybe some space for 'quote of the day'/'focus of the day' thing so that users could wright there. Thank you for all your work!",4
cd5961cf-08c2-4a4e-9f4f-0d6a23a03dd9,"Enjoying the app so far, my only downside is I wish I could pick how many tasks appear on each page because I don't think 6 is enough and swiping to see more gets annoying at times",4
884ff833-a503-48ff-9cb3-6ab2ed709173,"I'm editing my review because recently they fixed the 'free' trial issue. Now, you get 7 day actually free trial. No need to pay for the 7 days which I'm very happy about. The price for monthly subscription is... affordable but I wouldn't exactly say it's 100% worth it, maybe 7/10",4
9c8bfc13-980c-4f2c-9142-687a286b5632,the update is fun so far!,4
086b1a7f-fb77-499e-8bff-65d110297b4a,Interesting concept. Will be good if it allows for attachments such as images and documents.,4
6291efc4-493c-486f-9f79-e4347904bb15,"I've only used it for one day and i like the concept. I have two suggestions: 1. creating time log: provide the option to add completed tasks to calender and drag to specify start and end time 2. connecting with forest app: automatically create a timer in forest app with the name of tasks; When task is finished, time log entry mentioned in 1 can be automatically created from the timer.",4
46a844d1-6604-4e54-b417-817dd0130e6f,Love the gamification and the satisfaction it brings. It would be lovely to have a dark theme in the next update.,4
47b3461a-8588-4c62-8b4b-6386732491e6,"I'm a fan of forest and sleep town, but the moment I saw that the mascot Tada is a sealion I was all in... :seal::fish: So far very nice gamified app, though the tutorial where George is described the english text has odd grammar.",4
c3c08256-5752-48e1-b69f-2390ad3fb4b6,Atleast think about the students and give few services free. As done in forest app.,4
f8c05fb7-9ebd-41c6-bf54-c1cb98bb256b,"Seems like a really cool app, I just wish the write-up was a little more clear about the cost. You get a free trial, but the cheapest price is $14.99 for a lifetime subscription.",4
a338453c-6a2b-4fd7-9d62-9b2744729e20,"Love the update, wish there was a way to complete tasks in the review section if u forgot. Also really ant a dark mode please!! A way to access islands easier would also be nice.",4
d99d953a-7d64-449b-8bb8-0ce3a32592ca,版本更新後有全然不同的體驗，不管是功能還是操作都改善很多，好感度再次刷滿，看得出來終於聽見使用者的心聲了！:face_with_tears_of_joy:,4
7db16167-382f-4bec-b0e5-fb14512a208a,It really does help me get in track with my tasks. I like how this app is a mix of a game + to-do list.,4
45ad392a-8328-4fd3-ac6f-546a91c7b991,"Cute , i just thought this app can be developed more feartures",4
dfc09afa-1fe9-45f3-9702-0a056d7cc3b5,"This app really helps a lot to stay focused on what to do everyday. However I hope you will add more than 6 bubbles each day, then make it more interesting",4
29cde8f0-80d1-4bbd-8d96-0965baba10eb,It's a positive habit builder!,4
6ea56f0d-c754-4f37-ab44-eae55aa1182e,I don't know why people are trashing on this app. You should get it. It's fun and makes me actually want to work,4
46e1029e-c610-4f30-9ace-10b8cefb5930,"I like it, I love Forest so I figured I try this. Don't love the daily limit on tasks, I wish there was a way to disable that.",4
b910830a-f1f1-43d2-a860-26ec46ead15d,"This is really a great way of managing your tasks (although most of it - like seeing the reminders, custom tag, etc - can only be unlocked via paying money). Although, I feel there shouldn't be a limit to the number of water bubbles that can be popped in a day. Otherwise, it is pretty useful along with Forest, it's brother/sister app.",4
c2dbaa4a-fabb-4a49-aa88-f942bd95b16b,"I purchased this even without trying as its from the creators of Forest app, and its worth it. One feature i would like to see is, completing the partial work like when we have multiple check list items inside the task.",4
05968a7e-9ac2-4fe0-9f1b-7373b37038fd,"Very cool and fun. Great design. Nice premium price ($0.99)! Good options when creating notes, like the ability to ignore skipped recurring tasks. The ability to change the font size of task titles would be nice (or an auto-fit feature). It doesn't look good when words wrap inside a water ball. The option to adjust widget transparency would also be great, so it won't completely block out the wallpaper. The biggest issue is that it makes my phone really hot!",4
0cfb8bfb-41db-403e-b818-254e9b6dc2e9,I like it :two_hearts::two_hearts:,4
dfc72c69-7cd2-4179-858a-82167fc9b04b,It's cute and satisfying plus it really helps you to remember things.,4
199a0c95-75ea-49ea-9b82-365edea75927,"Fun way to run my day. I like the non linear day is planning with this app and the reward system to motivate tasks. I love to manage tasks by priority and the color coding helps to track down important tasks. This app truly fits my organized yet unscheduled way of working. This app is almost perfect, I just wish that tasks could have a start date and end date. Tasks are customized to forever repeated units with no option for 1 block of time never repeated besides 1 individual day.",4
0b9adecc-28cc-4698-923c-549f1f8ff6bf,"I like it, but I had a few suggestions. You should be able to buy things with the coins you earn. Also, the sun should reflect what time it is in real life.",4
d97669c0-9c0f-47f9-8282-4f5875d66afd,Good app !,4
4e7b6483-27db-4db2-8c37-ee268241c5c4,"It's really s good app. I really love all the three apps. guys u must try it out, if u r procastinator And would like to be productive.",4
e1c8b194-927a-4b4a-b70b-4b93cc4f8269,"I'm writing a review because honestly I don't understand why anyone would rate this app down. First of all, the price is really good. Secondly, it is the only app out there with such interesting gaming mechanism. It really works! Thirdly, you can have ANYTHING you've ever wanted: tags, lists, colors, cloud sync, nice 2D graphics, but also a simple task view (different views based on tags/priority/date), date, reminders, repeating tasks, bulk edit... I'm really into productivity apps and this one is definitely good. My only nitpick would be to make the UI a little bit more intuitive.",4
b9b1d79e-38e7-4da1-ba5e-77d1aac863fd,"I love SeekrTech apps and this is definitely not an exception albeit there could be improvements. The overall app is good but I wonder what happens when you unlock every collectible item available in the store. Another issue I have with the app is whenever I'm entering a Task title, it seems to me that I can't type quickly and have to go letter by letter(I used Microsoft To-Do before this and it worked absolutely fine) so hopefully this can be fixed ASAP. Overall for USD0.99 it's worth it!",4
83eecc69-f3ba-448e-bb1e-9a1c61f710c8,"I really like the app. I have one issue though. When making a new bubble, in the title bar, when i want to type something the text gets typed backwards and is in all caps. So when i want to type 'Laundry' it comes out 'YRDNUAL'. And when i want to backspace it only takes one letter away and jumps to the front of the word so then i have to click at the end again to backspace and repeat. I did buy the full version. Can someone please help",4
edacaaf8-624c-49c7-8d5b-05ad9d99c94a,"I really like the idea behind this. It does stand out as a to-do list app. I have two suggestions though to make it all the more effective. The bubble popping animation isn't the same as the one in the tutorial (which is a lot more satisfying to watch). I would like the option to change the bubble popping animation instead of being stuck with the default animation (the one where the bubble expands and shows the task details) beyond the tutorial. Also, add a punishment for failing. Thanks.",4
2a2c4a65-92cb-4458-8f26-21e05d4b4c6e,"Really helpful, gives motivation to stick with it. I wish it had more locations but I do like it more than other to-do list apps because it keeps you returning by giving you another reason to check it. I also would like the bubbles to be able to show emojis which I use to represent things such as laundry. Really has helped. By the end of the say, you can check with it to see what all you've forgotten and set reminders.",4
c58942d0-143d-4b02-bed3-0f1c9797b13e,I really like it! Only I can't put in more than 5 tasks a day because I want to use it at school projects to plan the things that I need to do but I do understand it because otherwise people are only going to add random tasks to win,4
ec2ed71d-cc10-41de-af0c-602521977290,"I really like this app! But I think it would be better if the list view is available at the home screen. edit: And it's available (the list view) and I can't say any bad thing about this app, 10/10... (Just a dark mode would better but I know it's a huge design change so I can accept this deficiency ) Thanks for your job I'll can't wait for the new app cuz I'm a fan now.",4
007dac3b-e6fe-4d22-b791-3ff749b37cd4,"Seekrtech never fails :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: This app helps me defeat procrastination through fun. I love the graphics and storyline. The only thing is - I would love if there was a social element. Tasks could remain private, but we would be able to see each other's journeys and characters. Maybe we could even collaborate. With all my other apps like Forest and Sleeptown, the social element is what keeps me and other users coming back. If WaterDo had that, I think this app could really change our lives :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",4
4df42caa-3a1c-46f5-b7e0-afc3226bf822,Good idea. Please make a widget for this app.,4
e9ff0513-5b76-4504-b701-fe0127e52b54,Really helpful for prioritizing and getting tasks done. Currently there's only so much to unlock but hopefully more locations and items will be added in future updates,4
31d7cfa3-0e84-4e9d-ab2f-db15c003a609,Good To Do List app. Only found problem (stuck at tutorial page ).,4
19ad6425-2b87-448b-8bcf-45ebfee5530c,Please make it synced with mobile calendar app. I have many tasks/reminders saved in Google calendar which can't be imported to this app; so got to use two apps for same purpose. Loved all apps by Seekrtech though :),4
be21f172-0bda-4378-881b-a192535f3175,"I like it. But just an idea, how about you allow users to connect this with their forest account? And just like forest, the tree planting one, you can do a water-related save-the-earth stuff through coins. I'm not sure what happens if the task is not done but if it doesn't have any consequence, I think you can include some.",4

4d860f95-d2a9-4dbe-98c4-4955db8cafd1,Updated review 9/8/19: the tutorial bug was fixed promptly and I'm loving this app! Helps me organize things in order of priority and it's very cute and interactive.,4
