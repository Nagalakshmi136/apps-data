12b390b0-b436-4451-a815-7448e36d8690,Great gamified checklist. I have three requests for features: 1) A list (not bubble) view that is limited to one day instead of all upcoming tasks. This helps me focus on immediately due items and not feel overwhelmed scrolling through the endless list. 2) The ability to reorder tasks in the list view and group by tag. It's currently unreliable (sometimes I can drag and rearrange the order but sometimes I can't). 3) Dark mode.,5

You add creativity and joy that is just the right spark to mundane but ever-important tasks. But can I suggest a few features? 1. Multiple task bubbles (pop the little guys to get the big guy) 2. Account sync with forest 3. Do you have recurring or assigning bubbles 4. Punishment for not popping in time like forest 5. Integration with forest so you can set task timer 6.

9f8a8029-430e-421c-b675-fe56071e10c7,best app i have ever found. i am a fan of the plant a tree one and sleep town. great job. are you planning on integrating the apps through a web platform? i would love to have a web platform with dashboards. you really bring value to customers and people,5
59a2c11b-22ed-4b30-8cd4-169f44a0ddd8,"I've found this app very motivating. Because it's easy to set up recurring items, it's also a great way to work on creating a new, good habit. I wish there was a way with the statistics to see your success rate with a particular repeating task (ex. Checked off ""floss"" 80% of the time). I also wish that when I did the daily review, I didn't have to reschedule daily repeating tasks to complete the review. I like this app a lot and have already recommended it to others!",5
0a1b7fec-f0af-48b9-9fce-a65c1d6a21ae,Beautiful and useful! I would only recommend to add a feature that allows you to specify the priority of a task.,5
486e2802-bfd0-46dc-b35a-cdb40a9e286e,"I LOVE this app! I used it on a trial for two days and couldn't get enough so I bought it! I would love it if instead of day cylcles, it had an option for half day cycles, so my evening tasks weren't crowding my list in the morning. So helpful tho!",5

c898e39b-da72-463e-afa8-a7515fd8f121,"All in all, its a great app. For a person like me, that lacks motivation to do anything it's helpful to get back into daily life. I would appreciate an option to schedule tasks on certain days, right now I can only choose between the frequency or work days etc. but some tasks I need to get done on, e.g, Monday Friday and Sunday, but I can't really schedule it like that automatically and need to do it manually. Love the concept with the island! I'm a forest pro user and I might buy this app too.",5
b98d8350-eeea-4c6b-aa07-c47244cbdc5e,Hello this is my 2nd review about WaterDo I finally purchased the Lifetime Version of this app. I'm very happy because I can use WaterDo now and I'm also happy that I gave support to the developers. good job for making wonderful apps. I just want more islands in the future to make me more motivated to become productive. Again I rate it 5 stars. Perfect:sparkling_heart:,5
93d73f89-a42a-4dda-856b-d9429448c00a,"This is a very nice app, love it! would be great to have some features like: - Organise the bubble as you want - Being able to change the size - will be great to have an option to have milestones for each important task, that way I would not need 10 bubbles for one task Will think of more, cheers!",5

Really satisfying to pop the bubbles to compete tasks, and easy (and dare I say it - fun?) to create your daily list each morning. I feel so much more on top of things now.",5
8aa6a9f2-6598-42eb-9528-542611cc1da4,I love forest and i like the calendar like sorting system in this app! Can we export our lists from Microsoft todo or like in the future?,5

f7daebec-94bb-4a29-bfe3-37ce3dddf768,"I think it will be great and more helpful for the user if there is a new feature where we can see all the task in a week in a timetable format. We can know all the tasks/our activity that have been setted in what time and what day, so we can manage our new activity (task) in our free time. I hope this feature will be updated soon in the future. Thank you very much.",5

a870e280-c355-46f7-9c74-a037d4dd7de6,"It's the cutest productivity app! I just wish there was a habit tracking feature where you can track habits every single day (not just a looping reminder but a literal calendar checking feature but with the same cute bubble popping feature but each time you complete a ""task"", or in this case, a habit, you pop the bubble on e.g. , June 12th Monday and you get rewards for everytime you complete a streak",5

f2efff9b-0d9e-4ac4-8903-76b5d0712a41,Just discovered this app after using Forest for a while. I decided to try it even though I was happy with a different list app. Water balls make tasks feel lighter and I like the reward animation I see when I get everything done. It's motivating and I'm a convert. (Love when the water level gets high and starts sloshing around! ),5
