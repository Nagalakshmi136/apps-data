00ffabdd-bba8-4b0e-b09e-ba3b0544ced7,Love it buyed premium just after two days. I have a suggestion: pls add a option to ring phone instead of a notification sound because when you are focused in your work i probably miss that and if there is a ring optionin settings i will definitely opt for that.(For both breaks and timer). Edit 1: Yes there is are some ringtones which will ring longer but then i will have to mute my device and then unmute it to stop it. Please make this in app built so it rings like an alarm.,5

It is so simple to use and yet so effective. No other pomodoro timer type app works this good for me as engross does. This is curated for studying but can be used for other focus requiring tasks. Premium version too is affordable and, honestly it's worth the small investment. Kudos to the Engross team.",5

d533c2e8-08c4-43da-9ed2-b5e30ac678cb,I really enjoy the Engross app. The break timer and work timer pop up at the custom interval and the screen stays on if you don't minimize the timers. Plus in the paid version you can tie the timer to a repeatable Todo task which I have set to run 8am to 8pm everyday. Each day at 8am the reminder notifies me and I can start the work/break timer right from the Todo. Well thought out in functionality and design. Love it! Thank you.,5

I also like how it pauses and waits for you to start the next phase. 10/27/21. Wow, I can't believe I've been using Engross for well over two years now. It's still just as good as ever. I learned how to fine tune the time spent concentrating. The 5 minute increment choices can be adjusted with the revise before or after, and the 5 minute break can be adjusted also.

cbfdfd78-3340-4760-bcbb-731b39f4582e,"Honestly very helpful so far. One of the better bullet list apps I've tried. It would be really nice to have an option to toggle off the due dates on tasks on the Inbox screen. A lot of tasks I input don't have a due date and it'd be nice not to see an overdue red ""July 8"" below a bunch of tasks in Inbox mode when I simply want to sort all my tasks via their priority. It distracts from the priority circles and the coloured labels I've made and makes things feel less organized.",5

Thing is I would love if u guys added an option to increase the time of break or focus duration when the countdown is going on. Sometimes it so happens we need more break than what we thought but when its in repetition we have no choice. So please look into this. Also the water reminder in each break is a good one:thumbs_up:.
