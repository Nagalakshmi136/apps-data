I love the pause feature, it's great, but it's good to know that optionally the pause button can be turned off in the settings.

I also like that the timer is flexible. The project I'm working on now requires longer slots of time so I set it for 45 minutes. Tapping the circle when my mind goes off topic is also helpful. Sometimes I never touch it and sometimes I click it over 10 times to remind myself to refocus",4

Fortunately this app's providing me a track of effective study hours I manage to get in a day which makes me reflect on and review my own output.

I wish the sub tasks (quick glance) on the ""To-Do"", section can be pulled down or hide, or show as you start working on the main task. Even better if the text don't get cut off (crosswise) if it's too long because it is awkward, the reason I suggestes above stuff. Do your magic and I believe it will be a better app!

It's nice to know that being distracted is ok, just be mindful of it and hit the button when it happens, and this in return helps me stay focused because it encourages me to be more mindful in general while working.

893ca3e6-9b3b-456e-854d-6c86bbe964e2,"I'm pretty pleased with this. It is 60-70% there. What it needs is a notification sound that is distinct at the point where it changes from work to break and vice-versa. As it is, it uses the default notification sound and that could be a text, a news story, anything. A distinct sound would be great - or the ability to set it to a different notification sound, and the option to toggle off the 1-minute warnings would be a bonus too (I find them pretty pointless).",4

The dark theme is excellent and tasks are well integrated with timers and calendar. The ""tap when distracted"" feature I haven't used long enough to judge, but it seems promising. I recommend this app! Features requests: **assign colour to labels** and **in task view, sort by label** (so all tasks are still shown but grouped according to label) This would be in order to create visual distinction between labels in task view.",4

d71a1691-cbde-4f1a-8585-4ae13904bf8d,A very convenient app if you have the problem of not being able to concentrate in your works because of constant distraction. It basically uses the pomodoro technique where you study in sessions for a long amount of time and take a shorter break. You can block distracting apps during your work.In the trial version you can only use limited features so better to buy it as it is one time buy. This app is useful not just for students but pretty much for anyone who needs constant deep focus.,4

The best feature is the reminder for a small walk / a water break after a long study session and the Hit me button when you're distracted. I am following this religiously and it's helping me miraculously focus more on my work. The other best feature is the automatic turnoff of the wi-fi so that I am not distracted by the notifications while I am working. It's a wonderful app!,4

d41e0489-9a62-43f8-8c7e-ce20ec135d83,"Been using this as a replacement for the Offtime app to block my app usage during work hours. The app blocking works nicely and doesn't block hidden background applications, or freak out if I happen to get a notification from a blocked app like Offtime has been. One thing that would make this the perfect replacement for Offtime is being able to trigger the timer to start automatically. I can't always trust myself to go in and start the timer myself, so being able to toggle a scheduled timer to start automatically would be useful. Another useful feature would be to allow the user to delete a single event from a recurring series, without deleting the entire event series, or even better, including Google Calendar integration.

Allowing me to set my minute intervals is great as it takes longer than normal for me to focus. Including being able to set how many times it repeats. Showing what time it'd end is nice too. Having a dark background helps as well so I actually like to keep the screen on near me since it's not distracting. I like to be able to glance at it as a reminder. My only critique or thing that I'd like to see if somehow there was a way to customize the ""steps"". You can write how many steps to mark off on the slider, but it would be cool if in some way you can mark off or label what each step is. I don't know how to fit that in the UI but it would make it more enjoyable for me rather than writing the steps beside the task's name or on a separate piece of paper.",4

The stats are very good as well, However there is not a way of the alarm sounding when it is on silent. I need it on silent so I am not distracted by text messages etc. I often miss the end of a Pomodoro timing because of that. Running on Galaxy note 4. Also if the screen could dim after 15 secs as it needs to be on all the time for recording distractions. I got round this by installing the 'Floating brightness' app. Also got round the sound notification by activating airplane mode and leaving sounds on.

No questions, thank you.) -Checklist system: If there was some sort of option to integrate this- a check box next to a task titled at the top during a session. Once the timer is done, either during the following break or right after the time is up, you can choose if you've completed the task or not.

I saw that you guys recently introduced the ""pause"" feature in this app. I really appreciate the change but having both pause and distractions feature separately feels kind of repetitive. Suppose, if i am engrossed in my work, any pause during that time will be the same as a distraction for me, right? What i want to suggest is that if the number of pauses can be counted as the number of distractions during the same work period, it would suffice both needs and calculate our efficiency based upon that as well. This way, the app becomes more minimalist in nature and has more reach to the audience. Thanks! :)",4

I am seeing that the developers are doing a great job with pace, I have a some suggestions. 1) As now you have added a feature to increment break by 5 mins and I used it many times, it would be a great addition if there is just a pop up when I add 5mins either while working or in break, like for example ""Timer will end now at 4:57 instead of 4:52"", 2) Also at the end of the timer, add a dialogue in which it is written how much time we spent in break or pausing the timer, 3) Add an option to skip the whole recap or revise time in between sessions and pop up a dialogue written this much time have been reduced and instead of 3:20 timer will will end at 3:10. 4) Add an option in settings to start airplane mode or silence the phone. 5) Add a section for blocking apps and whitelisting some apps, so during the sessions we can open just the whitelisted ones. 6) Enable sync with cloud so we can have access to our statistics from other devices as well. 7) Statistics section should show our complete not just the last months stats. I don't know whether these feature which I asked you for are already present in the app in some way or the other and I don't know whether these additions are even possible or not, I felt that since this app helped me, I should help this app too. bought the premium version.
