fd480ddf-472a-4467-8eac-407000a24d42,"Good enough for what it's supposed to do, but it had too many options/buttons for me - I just wanted a simple timer + break device. Good if you want to keep track of time spent on certain tasks though.",3

af153967-c764-459f-b5c9-d6a7637e2209,It works perfectly but I have one request. Since I stop Wi-Fi during work I am not able to use internet for other purposes. Only want to ban social media apps during work. Please make a provision so that I can separately deactivate apps for better productivity.,3

1f4f0c54-ac15-48a6-94fc-c5ff7aac9f7b,Really good but needs more than 6 times ( maybe let us type it with limits ) and also doesn't have a correct Integration into Google account. You should let us choose any account to OPTIONALLY log in and obviously sync across Android devices. Other than that it's all good. This app is really useful to manage time. I have a problem with the account selection. I bought with this account but I also have another account on my phone but engross pro does not work please fix this. I have paid for this!:angry_face:,3
d62ab6d0-2904-4345-aee7-7cc42e87411d,"An option to add time to the timer, or pause it would be good. Oftentimes I'm on a call through a break or even two.",3

bac7d071-ae1c-480d-b5a1-ca32a192d3f6,Nice app. But it must stop whenever one gets distracted n restart from that time. Only then v ll know for sure how long one has been studying or focusing on whatever task one's indulged into.,3
