I complete 1 Study session & I check it off on Widget & it disappears, but I still have 1 session left so task is not done. Also why does Widget not show the measure '0/2 Sessions completed'",2

Edit: That's kind of my point: why have unnecessary features, like building a schedule, on a 3 day free trial, but not the pause button which is pretty vital to the apps functionality and allows people to actually try out the app before deciding whether or not to pay for it. It just seems totally counterintuitive.",2

f2afd494-b5fa-475b-8265-c0838344c7b4,"Pls pls pls pls add a ringtone or sound options to notify us the timer is finished. We need to turn off the phone to avoid distraction as much as we can and not to let it ON ALL THE TIME.

After missing the timer many times because of it's feeble alarm sound and realising their is no way to edit it l promptly uninstalled it. UPDATE: I reinstalled it to cross check. Even on my highest volume the single beep i have for a notification isn't enough. Still no option to change that.

It's even more effective that way.,2

Not sure whether I was able to do what i wanted to do, since there wasn't an option. Decided to delete because I couldnt imagine using it with adds and I didnt want to have to work everything out. I recommend to the developers that you have a day free trial with no ads, so that users can get that full experience and see if theyre missing on anything.
