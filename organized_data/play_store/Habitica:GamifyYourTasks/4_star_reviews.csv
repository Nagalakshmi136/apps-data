If I had one suggestion for the developers it would be, for the non-daily habits, if you could add a timestamp for when the habit was last completed that would be helpful. Sometimes I complete habits and forget to tick it off in the app, then later I'm unsure if I already ticked it off or not. There is currently no way to be sure if you ticked off the habit in the app. Very small detail but it would improve the UX for me dramatically.",4

c69ba1e9-cb97-470f-9ec7-ae425a6fcc1a,I'm new but this looks like no regret but the problem is I don't see how this is supposed to gameufy your Tasks but I know people are downloading this app for their tasks and dailies and habits and not for the game thing the thing that I like about this is that you can change your Avatar and you have levels I Still couldn't find how to access the things on a screenshot but that's okay this also gets downloaded on my phone which is perfect so that I don't have to download it I can delete my basic to do list that I have on my watch and just use this to organize my habits and dailies and tasks this is perfect for a busy and rushed person I recommend You download it's thank you for reading,4

3ecce140-efd0-4a8c-9b53-42772be32194,I just started this and I think the idea is brilliant! I believe it will be a big help. But I have a question: is there an option to have a habit be done multiple times a week as opposed to set days? I.e workout 3 days a week. I think that would be a huge benefit.,4
feae8c49-42b6-49da-b240-58dd75866267,The app works flawlessly and it helps me a lot. I'm only giving 4 stars tho because it's missing a lot of features. Things like making extra lists or having a home screen window where you can see tasks more easily. If these features get added this app easily becomes a 5 star.,4

I would also love if you would get rewards for finishing checklist items not only thw whole task. I really enjoy using this app and it helps me with my every day life.

I just wish it had a little more complexity as It seems some of the stats are redundant, warriors only use strength and mages intellect. I don't think I'd use the other stats. Just a little more complexity and it would be perfect imo. Edit: also in party in chat it doesn't say the day the attacks were made so it's difficult to tell who has attacked on what day.",4

I did not quite understand the point of the habits vs the daily, vs the todo. Habit is just an any time of the day thing. Daily is just set tasks you have to do every 1-30 days.

This promotes procrastination (checking off complete habits) and late nights (to reset right at 12 and not lose overnight casts).",4

232bc5bc-ea18-463f-852e-faa6fdf7f2bf,This is an awsome app. I got so much done with it. There were a few things that could have been tweeked or adjusted. I also have adhd so i constantly forgot about it. Leaving a bad streak on the character stuff. But i loved it and it was alot of fun to use.,4

d0a630a1-4be7-449e-a243-ac5ba51f2a13,I really like this app just a couple of extra things I would like: (1) An option for weekly tasks that need to be done once a week but not necessarily on a certain day (2) An option to postpone a daily task once if I know I'm not going to get it done today but will definitely do it tomorrow instead.,4

I'd like to experience more of the RPG side of the game but with my bad health forcing me to take breaks quite frequently, the attraction of party accountability is nonexistent.

One thing which has been BUGging me for a few weeks is, that often when I open the app, all of my habits have disappeared. I then need to close and reopen to get them back.

I got this so I could show myself that I'm succeeding more often than failing, but it's annoying to have it constantly reset.

I love the fact that it has an acutal character for you to develop alongside you and quests, it would be cool if they made it a little pixel idle game.

The widgets that I can put on my home screen allow me to quickly mark off my dailies and watch my xp and gold grow.

This can help keep tabs on meetings and deadlines in a visual way which is much easier. 3) Can the color of a task be tied to the difficulty? It seems that those two arent related. 4) I just updated to a new version, the older one had the character portion of the screen with a pruple background instead of white.

4032a3fe-cb6c-4aac-ac4c-cd9043995256,"This app is incredible! It really motivates me to get things done and helps keep me on track. I like the fantasy RPG aspect of it a lot. My only criticism is that you have to use gems to change your class; I selected mage but pretty much immediately realized that I'd already invested a bunch of money into warrior gear and that I'd be better off just going with warrior, but since it's pretty hard to earn gems (I honestly don't know how) I can't change it. It's not a terrible inconvenience besides the fact that I levelled up the available warrior items (like axe and helmet) and now cannot further invest. It's merely disappointing that I'm stuck now. But, besides that, the app is super great. I really like the pets function (I dunno what they do, but they're cute!) and the quests give you some kind of goal to work towards (and thankfully, you can complete them by yourself). Plus, they're not a required feature! You can just use Habitica for keeping track of tasks if you want, which is awesome.",4

72124ee9-d573-4db0-ac02-ca831d5c97fe,"I have always been so bad at keeping my daily schedule in tact because I often felt like it was pointless. This app offers a way for you to complete your daily tasks, add free floating tasks, and habits that can cause negative or positive effects. And to top it off you get motivated with a game avatar to keep your health up for and level up! You can join partys so they you can meet people and fogjt bosses just by doing something as simple as ""replace toiletpaper."" Not only does it encourage the addition of every little task, but it offers a non cluttered way of showing it. I now know when I am missing something like meds and water before bed. And if I forgot to feed the animals before leaving home. And it keeps me in check. Not only do you have fun but you're held accountable by yourself. In a way that seems fun and easy. I use both the app and site as they both offer their own perks.",4

Also maybe a custom reward you get after the expire date if you completed it every needed day. Apart from that, great, great app",4

Habitica does more though. It actually motivates me as well as providing accountability. Because for some reason just being an adult is not enough motivation. I need to be motivated to find cool pretend animals and remind myself that if I don't do my stuff I'm going to kill my friends. Habitica works for what it's designed for.

I practice many crafts on a daily basis, so to create lists and be incentivised in some sort makes it great. From my experiences with friends, it doesn't work for everyone, but it works well for me. I would strongly encourage giving it a shot! 4/29: after recent update app has improved. I still prefer the desktop website. I would really love to see the streak counters on habits the same way the website does.

Been using Habitica almost a month, and many notice a difference in my productivity and attitude towards mundane stuff. I was worried about the ""game"" aspect because I have a tendency to ... obsess. But each 'quest' is a text-based little paragraph story that progresses a little bit every day based on how much of your list you or your 'party' group check off. It's either collecting things or beating up some sort of monster, and it literally takes as little time as you want it to. The $5 in-game purchases are cosmetic, not needed at all. But the $ does go towards improvements. There are two improvements I would like -- monthly or weekly recurring to-dos that don't clutter up your list, and adding checklists to challenge tasks.",4

The quest system, while not being perfect, allows me and my kids to enjoy seeing our work on tasks produce some results. The whole system does have some draw-backs, although being a community project, it understandable. The main drawback for me is the options for recurrance of tasks. You can either select the days for it to occur on by themselves, or select for it to repeat every x number of days. This is workable, however, certain tasks need to be done on certain days of the month, and since each month has a different amount of day, saying to repeat every 30 days does not work perfectly.

Yes, there are some things missing, and some things seem a bit wonky, but that's to be expected. If the rate of updates continue as it has since release, then this app will have a very bright future!",4

e4eb3067-c47f-4c69-8f09-7394da4e63de,"This app is absolutely amazing. However, a lot of my todos are entered into wunderlist. I was wondering if the future held any integration with wunderlist? That would make this app simply unbeatable by any other on the market.",4

I add a lot of details to it, but writing them is not easy since the textbox is very small. Also no easy way to read it other than navigating within that clunky textbox. The previous app did this better. Thanks for the great work!",4

011a606b-f107-4587-8641-bb25690123d7,This is a very neat app for keeping track of your productivity especially for gamers. I think the only thing missing is an activity log to review previous actions.,4
86e0ffee-e449-4d1b-84b8-364899ceeb13,"Much, much better than the old HabitRPG app. Still some things missing but I expect these to be added in time to bring it (mostly) up to parity with the website.",4
c59d1fb4-320c-4cbf-8812-6a63b378eec8,I find myself volunteering to fold laundry so I can get the sweet sweet exp. The app is a little bare bones at the moment but keep in mind it is still in beta. You need to go on the website to do a lot of things like organizing parties and quests,4
8549c200-3e22-4d99-9617-c712ccf01ba7,"Major improvement over the previous app. Looks great. Still a little sluggish for me to consider it a first choice over the website, with the way I use it to manage my tasks. With a little more speed in the way it processes habit/to-do/daily clicks, I'll be a huge fan and use this more than the website. Great work so far!",4
9a32a962-8adf-4d76-b8fc-d020ce693cd8,Please provide a walkthrough/ Tutorial on how to use this app,4
1d9297ce-5f22-400e-8afc-d44f3a1e15c7,The app works well so far. I also love all the little animations like when you type a note instead of the word note fading away it slides up. Or how your stats screen can be shown or hidden by scrolling up or down on the main page. You can tell a lot of work went into this app. Job well done.,4
8be49598-457f-4337-9c16-a4de60e8f372,"This is prettier, faster and cleaner than the old HabitRPG app and I love it. Only thing is, it's weird that you can't give to-do list items a due date. I'm sure that's in the works to be fixed, and once it is I'll probably use the app almost exclusively for my habiting. It's actually more useable than the website now, for the most part.",4
72eb1ad4-eda9-44f4-ad0c-f18dc42487cc,App is super close. 2 things: would love the ability to change the order of items in each list. And it would be cool if the widget showed your avatar as opposed to the habitica logo.,4

9735c47e-8dfe-413d-8c53-7579cbf8098c,Only rating a 4 stars because of pending features. Aesthetic wise it's awesome and way better than the other apps. My one gripe outside of pending features is I can't seem to figure out how to access check lists for dailies,4
a9e86e95-032b-4861-9d78-0a2d77fd8882,"The improvements so far from the old HabitRPG app are outstanding! I have been anxiously awaiting the android release and so far I am not disappointed. I am excited for the rest of the features to become available! A+ on the aesthetics as well, the old app was a terrible eyesore. The functionality and reliability seem much better too, although I have only played around with it for a few minutes so far.",4

I just have two suggestions: (1) It would be nice if the app allowed a bit more room for error when checking things off as I get taken to the edit screen more often than not ^^ (2) I would really appreciate having a guild tab. I actually redownloaded the Habit RPG app just so I could have an easier way to post messages in the guilds. Thank you very much!!",4
