Habitica responded: HabitRPG, Inc.December 23, 2020 Hi AFK, thanks for your review! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback. Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That ""About"" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the ""Send feedback"" does not even exist in the app. It's called ""Report a bug"". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also ""Report A Bug"" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all.

I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time. This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used. The avatars are hideous. The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections. It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality. The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection. Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item. Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience. Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over. Yea… I get no response from the developers. The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it. Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it. Its slow as hell. And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party.",1

A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother.
