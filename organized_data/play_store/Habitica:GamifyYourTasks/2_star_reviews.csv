I don't like dealing with random people but doing 4-12 damage to a boss that has 1000 hp... per IRL day... is absolutely not fun. great idea, horrible execution. If they add quest objective scaling to parties then I may consider reinstalling, but for now this app frustrates me more than it helps me.",2

Tried it for a week, but fails at the critical core function of a habit building/task app-- Can't provide consistent reminder notifications at scheduled times! Seems like a known issue. I tried adjusting phone settings to not sleep the app and other things but still fails. Guess I'm going back to using Tasks from google. Heck, my Casio watch from 1998 can still do it better!",2

cec4754a-6ef8-46e7-b466-d3c846f61ea8,It was pretty good until it started using push notifications to advertise to me.

There's clearly love put into this project which saddens me but I also don't feel any enjoyment using it beyond a surface level organizer. Losing health doesn't feel like an issue considering its not connected to experience or gold.

fea367ff-2a26-4ec2-a28a-4afbacaf9041,"Way too complicated. I get the idea, I like the idea, but it takes so much time and effort to use the app. There's no way my ADHD is gonna remember to do the task, and also check it off in the app and apply daily rewards to gain health etc etc. Its not a good enough app to make it worth using daily - it's not fun enough and not easy enough to make it worth the effort.",2

21ceca17-b5e0-4d63-8e85-3c665b44e5ce,It's more about the icon bundles than the purpose of the app. Even the Facebook page is full of posts about icon bundles (their habit) than HOW the app can be used to create habits.,2

d2cf49c7-c555-4d75-aa4f-cb8ee71ca7a2,"The reviews compelled me to download the app and I immediately started noticing bugs: First of all, no matter how many times I slide a task up, it only stays there for exactly 1 second before going back to its original position. This is one MAJOR setback for this app, not allowing users to organize our tasks and not giving us any options to prioritize certain points over others. Allowing us to at least number our points could help a lot, or make it possible to categorize them based on urgency.",2

58207893-ea33-45dc-ad11-31fda23a9703,The UI design is unapproachable and difficult to understand. Very old fashioned. There is no tracking inside the app itself for HP loss or habits over a month - the longest reset option. To check my habit stats I had to go on reddit to find that Habitica has a separate site for that. Heavy on the game aspect and the habits come second. Uninstalled after 2 days of use as I felt too overwhelmed with everything around the habits.,2
2dcac131-94d9-45ab-ab27-f01c6db07cd3,"The app is well designed, but an update is needed: When I press on a habit/daily/goal button to complete it, there is a delay before the app responds visually and with sound. I experience this consistently on different devices. I imagine the problem is that it waits to get a response from some server before it reacts. If so, I think that should be reworked. It feels very unresponsive, and diminishes the feeling of satisfaction from finishing a task.",2

I'm pretty sure the developers have abandoned this app it never gets updates, and it's pretty bare bones when you look into it. There's a lack of items and clothes to customize your character. There are better options out there now. Goodbye Habictica, you seemed helpful, but in the end, you were dissapionting",2
e3280381-7112-421b-bc9d-c1dc49bb8c01,"Subscription based. A one time cost for the app could work, but a subscription to access features like playing with friends is dumb. The last thing people who struggle with day to day life and organization need is another bill.",2

Unfortunately, updating the app doesn't fix it. I've had issues with sync for as long as I've used the app. My partner also has these problems on iPhone.

Some advice: ●Make the quests you can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a freeby starter egg or a background or outfit).

Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work.

I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads.

18afe1a4-8ddd-4716-ae30-6a36fffc73e1,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did.",2

That could be forgiven (still beta), and I still decided to support them for a great concept, however when I did so and went to the in app store it ate some of my diamonds and didn't give me the background pack I requested. That's not an acceptable bug, even for a beta.",2

c104243e-ddbb-4949-aed9-8dcf3997b3e8,"I am a big fan of the browser version of Habitica, and I use the dailies feature to successfully juggle my regular responsibilities as they come and go. I was excited to see that the app was getting a much needed overhaul. However, the dailies section of the app shows ALL dailies, even completed ones, with no option to display only the tasks that are Due on a given day. Seeing obligations I perform only on certain days or intervals mixed in with due and completed tasks render the app sadly unusable.",2

It doesn't update between days smoothly. Sometimes I log in and if I just look quickly, it seems like I did my dailies. But wait, those were from yesterday! Log online and sure enough, they aren't checked off. Go by the app, and you'll lose health/die. Also I hope guilds and pets are added soon! That's half the fun!",2

Instead there is one warning for all the tasks and it doesn't even notify, ever. (2) instead of the color of each habit/chore changing upon completion, each habit/chore should be a pet that grows every time you complete it. (3) I switched to Monsta Points app, because I can define my own rewards a little better. But I would come back if (1)+(2) were true.",2

How am I supposed to remember habits throughout the day that I haven't formed yet? Very impractical and disappointing that you can't choose separate reminders for each habit like HabitBull.",2

Bugged out on my Sony Z3 compact twice in the first 5 minutes: one, when buying a health potion seemed to take my health to 0, and give me the 'you died' message (checking the Web app, this didn't actually happen, it was a bug in the habitica app and I had in fact gained the correct amount of health). Two, the app crashed when using the backstab skill. It also doesn't show the amount of gold received for skills.",2
