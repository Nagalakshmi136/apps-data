I initially thought I wouldn't really be motivated to progress the small, pixelated character, but collecting the backgrounds and pets/mounts proved to be highly motivating. I still use todoist to keep track of some more complex or recurrent tasks, but nothing actually motivates me to complete tasks like this app. (I move the tasks todoist gives me for a given day over to this app in shorthand form)",5

I don't use the rpg features in game but I like the layout and usability of this app more than of other habit trackers.

I like to spread out my quests evenly throughout the week and if I could see on which days I already have a lot to do I could create new quests on different days.,5

I do wish that the circular plus icon to add tasks wasn't there because I find it unsightly and literally every app has it.

My only gripes are that, occasionally, there are glitches that make it so if you drag to reorder something it goes farther than it's supposed to, and it will display the habits as a different habit than it is. These are easy to fix by restarting the app, though. I also really want a way to copy a to do, habit, or daily so that I don't have to rewrite a long check list on a to-do that only appears again on an irregular basis.",5

Add in tight communities and an infinite number of challenges to pick from, many many different play style and motivation schemes and you have an impressive tool for life. I like to use it to curb impulse spending. If I want to buy something, I put it on my rewards, and then complete my tasks and dailys until I can afford my desires through productivity.",5

I've also been using it to be kinder to myself and give myself credit. And when I drink soda, my first thought is where's my water so I can balance out my ""Hydrate or Diedrate"" habit.

This app however, brings out the best in you by rewarding you in points that you can use to buy inventory for your ""quests."" At first, I felt skeptical because I believed that I would waste all my time playing the rpg version of this game more than my tasks, but all was well when I figured out that the ""quests"" are actually completed behind the scenes and are only dictated by your ability to stay on track.

Great if you need instant gratification and that rush of dopamine and reward when you complete mundane tasks, which I do :grinning_face_with_sweat: found this on an ADHD help video and have been hooked ever since. I've stopped nervous habits like biting my nails, and my sleep schedule has gone from sleeping at 4am til 2pm, to consistently sleeping at 11 and waking up at 8 WITHOUT AN ALARM. I can't stress what a big deal that is, I've never been a good sleeper. And this is all in just a week of using it. Plus doing things like chores is a lot easier. In conclusion, I love it and would (and have!) reommend to all my friends.",5

But for some reason, I kept losing interest over time. I don't know how, but that hasn't happened with Habitica. At first I thought the little character and pets we're sort of dumb, to be honest. I really didn't think it would keep me engaged. But somehow it has. And now that I have become leader of my Party, it's even more fun. I became an annual subscriber even. Honestly, it is plain weird but I like switching out my costumes & winning more pets. Now I am giving gems to members of my party as thank you's. I can't explain it. It just works for my brain. And now I love it! Give it a try. You never know what will click for you.",5

Started going to gym and jog for 30 minutes afterwards. This is only the big stuff. Also my friends got onto this and we are fighting a big snek thing at the moment,5
01a74a39-51b3-4f0c-8e04-6dc6b422b8d1,"This app is literally Epic! I have tried many other apps for gamifying my life but all of them fell short. This really keeps me engaged and helps me to organize my life in the same Fell Swoop. My only suggestions are 1. I wish I could have a way of having someone in my party close to me, like my fiance, be allowed to make requests of me by putting things on my to-do list in exchange for a prize or some other kind of offering on their part. This takes out the constant reminders she tries to give me and requests she makes of me when I'm not really paying attention and often don't feel like taking the time or I'm not in a position to put these new things on my to-do list. 2. I see a use for having checklists available in the habits category. 3. It would be extremely motivating if there was a way to see a list of the things that I've finished and when I finished them. This way I can keep track of my productivity overall and perhaps even show someone my productivity if it were ever put into question. Also I don't know what to do about a finger slip if I hit something and I don't even know what the task was I just know that I didn't rightly finish the task. Glitches like that happen all the time.",5

There's a lot of small simple things that can be added to the actual organization system that can make it much more effective on people For now (bigger concerns), - PLEASE allow task ( and etc.) making/ setting/ marking (and etc.) to be allowed to be done OFFLINE, it's worth it and will be effective trust me - when making tasks and all that good stuff there's an option to have a start date. This does nothing, I suggest that this should let the said task or etc to only show up on the date you stated, or have a tag you can activate to show it, or at least not turn red or damage you until the start date of your choice, or just some concept of long term task setting(please) - when I try to make a party in the mobile app it directs me to a window in chrome, that then tells me to use the mobile app. Really love this, best of wishes in developing :)))",5

5fb51be4-f3f2-4089-a1f6-416f864fea36,"This app now runs my life. It has honestly made me so much happier, and much more productive. And it's fun, too! It basically makes life much less confusing, by neatly sorting all the things I have to do, and then rewarding me for doing them. Not just in-game rewards, either: you earn gold in the game, and then you can design your own real-life awards that you buy using in-game money (for instance, by spending ten pieces of Habitica gold, you can allow yourself to watch half an hour of television). Obviously you can cheat, by pretending that you've done things that you haven't, and rewarding yourself withoutbhaving earned it, but you'd only be cheating yourself, because the real reward is the progress you've made in your life! Before Habitica, I was unhappy and struggling to find purpose. Habitica gave structure to my life, which helped me to achieve much, much more than I previously was, which gave my life a new meaning. I am now a happy and productive person!",5

I have been completing tasks that I would normally put off for days at a time. I'm a mom of 3, two toddlers and an infant, and the small reward of XP for doing things that nobody appreciates or notices is sometimes just what I need to get through the day. What I do is important and pressing a button that acknowedles that I have done something productive makes me feel good. So yeah, I would totally recommend this app.",5

3927cf6c-cf5a-4396-a481-29110b8e1704,"I love this game! It would be nice if the app had more features that reflected the site. Like the counter for habits. I often have to use the mobile site for things because I can't remember if I've given a particular habit e correct number of tapps yet or not. I keep the mobile app on my phone for notifications. Android Wear support would be nice. I know that might be a nother app, but if the widget had functionality it could be used, via an android wear app called Widget, that let's you put your widgets on your watch. Currently the only widget that is functional is the habit widget since you only need to click the button, but dailies and todos require opening and checking the lists which the widget can't do. Updating the widget would cover both widget users and watch users. It would work great if there was only one widget that you swipe left and right to move through habits, todos, and dailies, up and down to move through tasks in each category, and adding the option to expand and click checkboxes.",5

Also includes to-do checklist, eliminating the need for another app for that. Although it is a little too cutesy and low-res graphically for my taste, the idea is just so much fun that I can overlook it. Great community involvement. Misses the graphical display of analytics that Loop has, and display of streaks on the calendar that HabitBull has. But the increased fun factor makes me actually do my tasks more than such graphs/calendars.",5

But once i engaged in the community i saw a group of people who are actually trying to improve their lives and the lives of other around them. The challenges this group sets are grisly inspiring such as carrying a bucket with you around to pick up trash while playing Pokemon go or doing one or two ransom acts of kindness. Truely a great app and I'm proud to be a member,5

23885653-64a0-41a3-bb65-5ce80c9678b2,"A world of difference! Some time ago, I downloaded this app when it was still called HabitRPG. It was clunky and in early development so I didn't hold onto it for long. Never would I have guessed that, over two years later (give or take) it would have developed so much! The outlay is beautiful and aesthetically appealing. There are a plethora of things to do within the app itself with that list ever-growing. I am very fond of the checklists that have become a central focus as well. As a novelist, there are many pieces to the writing process. Many apps lack the option to list in parts which quickly becomes problematic. Instead of neatly being able to find a certain item, I am stuck digging through either the list itself or tags to find it. That is ten minutes or more of wasted time. Habitica allows me to organize everything neatly, filing it away beneath one point. Perfect for long-standing novels, shopping lists and more! A fantastic app. Congratulations on your success, Habit!",5
