663b4e0b-ed2f-46be-ad43-76f714421c7e,I couldn't figure out the difference between dailys and habits. Maybe habits are for punishing yourself if you do them more than once a day? Or things you can do more than once a day? Or don't require punishment if you miss a day? I also wish the art was more kawaii... I know I've got niche tastes but an anime skin is something I would pay for.,3

36b8313a-1825-4c0a-b305-4b9f1cd9293c,Amazing idea but watch the subscription and read the fine print. I bought a subscription for me and my children. But then I noticed you don't even get an hr glass or gems until 3 MONTHS after subscribing not even one to start with or unless you pay for the gems. I feel as though we should receive some gems for subscribing and at least ONE hr glass to start with. Me and my children enjoy the app and using it. But not sure if the subscription rewards are worth it when you don't get much gold.,3
e62711dc-9316-4140-ac59-1d1ceb6f3404,Its great but most of the things are bought by gems and its a bit frustrating i usually try to see how far i can get in games without buying anything and im already close to that limit and i have been playing for 6 days.

Now the volunteers devoting much of their time to helping people & making the app more accessible/user friendly, all those discussions in guilds and taverns, they're all gone.

The app is slow in responding to let's say a to do being checked and other stuff.

The concept of gamify to build habit itself surely fun on its own but since the updates on how new members can only be recruited if the request for it is making this apps dry. The process of recruiting becomes difficult for party and hence reduce the efficiency of each party (few members joins quests). It also reduce the interaction between the apps users itself.

75660faa-30bc-458d-afd3-583e6e81109e,Great for ADHD - it really helped me organize my tasks and gave me motivation to finish them. Unfortunately it's very unforgiving if you fail your tasks. If you hit zero health the game says you'll lose your progress on your current level but neglects to mention that it also takes all your gold and deletes one of your items. That was enough to get me to quit the app altogether since losing limited gear I worked hard to get was extremely demoralizing.May try it again if they make it less punitive,3

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",3

If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards. Don't have it? Get it, and start it. Try it for a couple weeks if you can. Keep reading...",3
