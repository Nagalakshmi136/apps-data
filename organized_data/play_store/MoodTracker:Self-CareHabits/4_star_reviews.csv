780f8781-9b8a-4fc2-b9d6-513def6bcdc1,I love how interactive this app is with all of the activities you can do and with taking care of your pet. It is motivating to do the tasks to unlock rewards and it helps me to write down my moods and what I am grateful for and appreciate in my life. It helps me feel more grounded. It is a little annoying how many ads pop up it sometimes gets in the way of properly processing my mood after breathing or poping the balloons. Other than that I highly recommend,4
