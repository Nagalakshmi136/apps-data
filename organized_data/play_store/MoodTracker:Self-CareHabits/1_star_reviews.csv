I'm giving it one star because I purchased 100 clovers in two different settings, was charged each time and didn't receive the clovers. I thought maybe the first time was a fluke, but then it happened the second time I tried. I contacted the support email and never heard back.",1

Emotions or moods are not ""good"" or ""bad"" they are just moods or emotions. Assigning a concept that is so closely linked to morality (good vs. evil) is damaging and dangerous.
