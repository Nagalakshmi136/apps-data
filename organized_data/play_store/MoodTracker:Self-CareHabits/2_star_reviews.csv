5b016f33-8339-445c-a819-71a9de8e840c,"I jumped right in and payed for this app because a therapist I respected recommended it. I suggest you use it for awhile. I would not suggest paying for this app. The diagnostics are not helpful to me. The process gave me nothing that assisted me in any way after a few months of use. I suggest emoods and moodflow. Between the 2 you can track your mood, symptoms, time stamped notes, as well as a place to journal observations, brief gratitude statement daily and powerful quotes.",2
351c9644-e7aa-437d-9cf9-b52429d4c0d7,Is wasnt soo bad i like having the little penguin buddy but after having to move some of tha apps on my phone i wasnt able to pick up where i left off - so i lost all my clovers and tracking data - which in the long run defeats the purpose pf the mood tracker app.,2
a6a74393-8a34-4f80-8fd8-1ce7ae4eaeed,"They barely have any icons for customized new activities and habits. I don't get that. They have more icons for activities that are preset and same icons are not even available. Also, it's a shame that the habit tracking is weak. Mood option are limited to just 5, need more",2

522ff20c-ed23-4145-96cf-223847a2c0aa,"Thus really isn't a good app for those who ACTUALLY want to track there mood. There are some good features tlike the tasks but the actual mood tracker is just awful. Also the pet cost money to by pants (it's a bad reason but if your gonna offer it you might as well give it clothes!) . If you actually want to see how your feeling throuout the day DO NOT USE THIS, I recommend an app called Finch. It is way better than this.

f5797d3c-3592-4450-87b0-9dcaa9b228d6,"The design is cute and everything. It helps a lot to keep track of mood. However, the staff isn't the best. I had initially bought the yearly subscription (by accident) instead of the lifetime. Assuming that a refund was requested immediately, I made the stupid choice to buy the ""lifetime."" Short story short, I tried contacting the developer immediately for a refund; but they never responded. I ended up stupidly paying 2X for this app. 2 stars due to design, & functionality... -3 for staff.",2

I had to attend a one minute call while I was writing something important to me and after that, everything was gone. PARAGRAPHS and hours were totally gone.
