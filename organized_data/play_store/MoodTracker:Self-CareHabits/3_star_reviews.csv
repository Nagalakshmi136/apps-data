But i want to suggest that you should add some more activity icons as there are so many activities that i want to create but there's no related icon for that. All those are just default and pre-made icons. I would like to suggest that you should create icons for all of the emojis in phone as the activity icons. So that if I'm creating any new activity i can have lot of options and i can directly relate to that icon.",3

f0e020ae-9ef0-406c-b02a-619e1ebc3e4c,So I like the app in all but there is two problems. One is that notifications keep popping in my face. Two is that they say that you have to pay yearly and I do not know what that means. So I guess the app is cool but they need to update a lot.,3

866eda72-12dc-4ffc-8a7a-db73d95b3ffc,Wish I opted to try out a month before buying a year subscription. The design and layout of the app is cute and customizable. Does what I wanted/needed it to do... but wish my completed habits were easier to see in the calender feature. I really dislike having to pay extra to mark habits completed if I forget to update them the same day. Would be nice if the paid version was a bit more forgiving about editing the calender,3

5da93f3b-cce7-4582-ad69-f03be2dfe149,"First of all, ""good mood package"" mechanic is a bit confusing, as you can only get it once a day. Second, there are too many in-app purchases. Not something you would expect in a ""mental health"" app. Throwing money at your mental issues won't fix them. No idea what developers were thinking. Overall, it's an average reminder app for vaguely related to mental health chores. Your Google calendar can do better than that, for free!",3
