12d5fb99-6bb8-4c05-8748-114c229acf00,The app is good but I want to add my tasks on google calendar and manage on prosper. Unfortunately prosper is not fetching tasks from google calendar. I have sent email but still waiting for reply.,3

bf0cd3c1-fc6e-4221-9753-d50aeecc79e4,Update: reinstalled today.. the app appears to be working properly since the update. Great job on the quick resolve. App is glitching.. as I scroll the page is blank then there is some flickering and the schedule may or may not load. I have to close the app out a few times and come back and 1 out of 6 times may get it to remain visible as I scroll. Please assist,3
d1f4b03d-13f0-43d9-843b-d62e8bdc3ac5,I wish app was able to sync back to my Google calender... Otherwise it will always remain secondary planning app. It can take/import data from Google calender but different sync back/export to Google calender. It's tiring to update both Google calender and prosper.,3

Have option to show full day timeline (including empty space) in specified increments (e.g., every 15 min) to visualize better available time. 3. Make tasks visually consistent in their size in relation to time they take. 4. Ability to adjust time of repeating task for one day when dragging without changing other days. 5. Have synced browser version.",3

ce42a304-2a84-46e0-b17b-16d2d0b07aec,Seems like a good app but I choose to uninstall it only for one reason witch is probably a niche case. I schedule stuff until 2 am and that automatically moves the task to the next day. It makes sense and it's not a huge thing but I would have loved a way to choose what hours do I consider a day.,3

I subscribed both Prosper and Disciplined. I wanted to ask the Devs if it's possible to set up alarms instead of reminders, since having ADHD has a strong tendency to ignore notification if not opened when picking up phone.",3

7383469b-d434-4853-bf7e-0439d1cd5756,App works ok. You cant add an all day task the same as a planned one (all i wanted to do was have my stuff in a list with NO TIME SCHEDULING putting a time on everything is annoying and thats not how life works (make there be a 00:00 time on the planned side and there wont be any problems),3
3ff4fdb4-597e-4e2b-a191-e9d5a158016c,"I use it to time block my days. The easiness of creating a new block and the way the timeline is displayed, both in the app and widget, are what makes the difference for me. The completions and the statistics don't really matter, the way you can define the 'tasks' is not granular enough for them to be useful. What I really really miss is the possibility to save tasks, that would make time blocking my days much faster. I'm still giving the premium a go but this is almost a turn off.",3
5062ea16-6d19-4466-b991-b92de7f1ef70,"I'd make it more minimalist reducing as much as possible amount of buttons, buttons like the add task button, statistics button, search button and unscheduled task button. Maybe i'd group them in a menu in the lower right corner",3
1739960e-2a20-4303-8ce3-5061fb015519,"A really nice looking app, but has some missing features. First is that the widget does not show the date of the task. This way if you do not have a lot of tasks, you don't even know when you should do them. Second is the lack of ability to sync with Google Tasks. I have been using Tasks before and finding that I would need to rewrite everything manually turned me off.",3

184aa408-a090-4a63-b279-56bec28922dc,"I think this is really nice in a lot of ways, but I wish you could set default colors for task types without having to add an extra step every time something is in a category (e.g. I want home tasks green, work tasks orange). I also just moved some stuff from my inbox and they just...disappeared and wouldn't slot into times I set. I won't be renewing but it has a lot of potential.",3
06690851-5787-46d8-8895-09e93ff775fd,"It lacks predefined time blocks that could be added by one click. The same tasks must be added manually every time or set as repeatable. Besides, setting the time by scrolling these rolls is horrible. Excluding these two minuses the app is good.",3

Two: removed - Okay so 7 minutes after submitting this an update came fixing the biweekly issue haha Other than that it looks really nice, has a lot of functionality and you can clearly see the developer has put a LOT of their time and passion into the development of this.

c44fd329-1059-4fb5-aa92-fb74c9368bdc,Good app -however Google calander integration seems to be one way only? would be great to be able to export/sync tasks created in app to show on Google calander.,3
f52bae25-46f1-4d48-ae9a-be31daca663a,Please provide a monthly calender view. Currently there is only a day by day view which isn't useful for looking at the week or month ahead. Very good day by day planner however I have to use another app to look at weekly or monthly.,3
d2e6c904-dd19-4e0c-91ab-144a1637a9c7,"Really like the user experience of this app EXCEPT for one thing, and it's a big thing. When setting the time duration of a task, the end time never sets to the time I set. I usually have to set it and go back in to edit the time and usually the 2nd or 3rd time it will set it correctly. When setting a duration from 2 separate days such as 10pm-3am, the app won't accept that input once it passed midnight. I was considering paying the lifetime option for this app until I ran into those issues.",3

62e1fba9-68a8-4e93-a7c7-13a19a772d68,Looks great but it's yet another app that requires a subscription. I recently totalled up my monthly subscriptions and it's eye watering! It's not sustainable. But we should at least be offered a 7 day trial before adding another one to that tab. EDIT: Thank you!,3

It looks nice & it looks like it'll be helpful in time tracking/ planning my day. However, I wish that tasks that end after midnight show up on both days instead of just on the first day.

There has been a lot of lag in the app. When i open the app, it randomly freezes for 5-10 seconds. It's really annoying, because it also happens when I'm creating a task.
