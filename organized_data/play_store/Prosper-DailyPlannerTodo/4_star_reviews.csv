3282108e-2eb2-4ec9-9067-421bbd8237a6,"It's a really good and neat basic daily planner. I really need something like this because I always forgot important stuffs. Suggestion: 1. Please make the time ""Slider"" to just input edit the time, it's hard especially if I need to add multiple task, fast, before I end up forgetting again. 2. SNOOZE: I'm used to using alarms as early warning and 5 minute snooze as the proper alarm. Thank you.:green_heart:",4

It's pleasing to look at, easy to use, and surprisingly motivating for how simple the reminders are. It sucks that some features I needed are behind a paywall, but I understand the need. Fortunately, the lifetime option is affordable and worth it for me.",4
c942bb8a-0d1f-4805-8215-d1a94c841a04,"It's such a good app: it's simple, user-friendly and intuitive. And they made a great habit app as well!! I'd love to see tags/groups in both apps, presets for reminders (i.e. 30mn, 1h before..) and the same interface for the time duration as the habit app (which is better). I'd be nice to be able to change the color theme of the apps but it's not really important",4

89adeee8-4922-4a77-a052-e2e391925b32,"Overall great app. A feature I would like to suggest : Instead of creating events through plus button ,setting the start time and end time and duration, we can just HOLD AND DRAG DOWN in the timeline on a particular date, to make new events for required duration. And when holding and dragging is done, it can give us a prompt to add name, color, reminders. For that purpose, make all 24 hours permenently visible in timeline, all the free hours can shrink. Please consider doing this.",4
2bdac478-8161-403c-99f9-941d538c91ec,"This app is simple to use I am speechless I have not gotten time to take a look at the prime features one would pay for, but I'm pretty sure the prime features are worth the purchase. Try this app get rid of the old Palm Pilot style calendars that are everywhere. Or sync your calendar with Prosper.",4
872ecbee-23ee-4c4d-890e-ba6670e5f0af,Very good app ....if i talk about another scheduling apps....they don't send notification or send notification in delay of tasks....but this sends notification of tasks at time.. and this is best for scheduling your day....,4
4484484a-8604-48f1-9dad-8c599d35dbd3,"Very great because it allows me to make a schedule for my day using time blocking which I love and adore, and also check it off when done completing it, thus giving me that satisfaction and dopamine release. Only suggestion; Please please make so when you make tasks in the out box/inbox area (not yet scheduled area) that you can plug those in easier to the next adjacent time slot, that it automatically chooses the next available time slot isntead of always making you do it manually.",4
317d7508-8d95-42c1-b619-a48dfb0f00a4,I'm really liking it! I recommend anyone give it a go. I really benefit from keeping visibility of my stuff even if some of it overlaps. Wishing for a desktop version to sync with.,4
a4dbfac0-1863-4294-87df-410c1a91c842,Hi sir I am using this aap from last 6 months . The aap is very good for doing task within a time no doubt about this. But a small problem is that this aap should have option for showing subtask without clicking the task. Please resolve this issue sir,4

f7e99eff-31c3-4346-806a-88284d495550,"So far, so good. A little too early to give 5 stars (I've only used it for 12 hours!) But I really like the timeline. It is super simple-just what I want! You set tasks for certain times during the day and as time passes you get little notificatuons when to start and can check them off when completed. Very easy and fun to use. So far has helped me accomplish the everyday tasks I might otherwise put off or delay. Might help me establish habits I want to develop. Will re-rate in a few weeks.",4
cd071f41-3385-434f-8134-a707cd47143b,"The application is great, no doubt about that. Just add feature which allows us to mark incomplete task. It would help us to see which works left undone. And also if supposed we were not able to complete a task, we should be able to write a remark for that that why such thing has not been completed or generally we can add any remark to the task.",4

The only thing I want changed is the push notifications. They should be more visual, with the icon, colour and title of the activity that it is reminding you of.

36702c2a-ebec-42fc-9da2-8ef039456d8a,"I like the flexibility of moving things around and the visualization of the tasks in a chronological way, it's very helpful for my tiny brain who can't focus unless there's shapes and colors.

220ba692-52ce-493a-b0b3-298f69663d4c,Love the app but it would be great to have a sync button that refresh the connection with Google calendar. Something it takes days to refresh it. This is the only issue that I have right now,4

b687e400-b018-47d0-9cd5-cc8b3320c7eb,"Useful app. My one critique is that it would be more useful if there was an option to see my week at a glance, as well as my day.",4
681e2b44-201b-4d17-be63-f278c9b3c568,"I like it so far, the drag and drop is amazing. Would it be possible to change the time setting from a scroll wheel to a type in? Or have a setting to choose?",4
4ab9fa50-feee-49b6-af15-b2a6e6285d01,It's early days but so far I'm impressed. I think it would be useful to be able to zoom out to see all tasks for a day & all tasks for that week instead of just the compact mode though. Maybe to zoom in and out etc.,4
9aa5acab-2744-4e54-8383-26d5a3351559,In avg 10/10 but there is some tech problem and bugs here and there but really happy with it... Already subscribe to it :melting_face::red_heart:,4

But this app- is soooo good (almost perfect). I really like the bright, beautiful colours. Overall it's a really nice app. However I have some suggestions: 1. Please introduce an option for daily automatic backup. 2. If possible, please design a pc version so that laptop users can also sync their data from the mobile app and utilize the amazing features.",4

The app does not auto-scroll to the present time of day. 2. When scheduling a new task, I'd like the option of adding a task from my inbox. 3. The ability to send a scheduled task to my inbox for scheduling later. 4. The ability to select and move multiple tasks at a time along the timeline. Thanks in advance for your consideration.",4

The only complaint I have is the way the app shows items that overlap other items. If you're trying to schedule something at the same time as something else, such as a lunch during a work day, there needs to be a better way to represent it. Having the item fall below the other item with an ""overlapping"" tag is confusing and hard to look at. Otherwise, love everything!",4

I think it could benefit from differentiating tasks from events or blocked off bits of the day.

3be52fb3-c4f4-4bc0-b215-6ea290361c55,"The only routine app that allows a task recur every X days. Well thought out features - no more, no less. Only wish the app font is modern than Poppins font.",4
d33bd580-ad52-4471-b6e5-01f29d718ba2,good app you can plan your daily tasks,4
f21b46dd-81c6-49ca-909d-ddc732dcf4f9,"Very nice, and easy to use. Just wish there was a feature that allows you to put one day stuff into all days. since my days are all the same",4
007cfd8e-df70-4ced-bef2-78529e032f07,"Has potential. I need subtasks to show and be interactive on the main screen (I don't want to select ""morning routine"" to see all the tasks I've got listed). Also, titles should have every word capitalized. Subtasks default to lower caps, annoying to have to capitalize each one. When adding a new subtask, the cursor should automatically move there so you can start typing without having to scroll and tap on it. Will keep an eye on this one, definite potential.",4
5eabfa6c-7d6f-4ed1-bf47-acbc49d5d390,I'm giving this a 4 star rating but just for the time being seeing as I've not yet fully been able to properly experience the app and have only just begun to explore it's features. I will go ahead and say it all looks very promising and it may even be the planner app I've been longing to find! Super excited to continue to check it out further. Will update my review after I do.,4
cd9830df-08a3-4bee-abc0-975f430ba7b6,"Good app, fair yearly pricing too.",4
36ed1e85-6e4d-4065-b7d0-048e9ffab052,"This app is the exact thing I have been looking for, for the past years. Beautiful UI, intuitive task creation, very friendly dev, with reasonable pricing for extra features. I know this app is still new, but it would be great to see some features like reminding a set amount of time before a task (currently has to be set as fixed custom time), completed tasks at the top as filled circles, or maybe even a calendar view. However, just as it is, my favourite day to day planner!",4
bf22fe03-bc0a-4429-879d-749c430e34df,Yes. Good.,4

edbc697f-213d-40e7-8218-e3ec74fc3187,"I've tried 2 more Apps earlier and this is by far the best... The first day, it took me a long time to make the schedule... For the second day I copied the common tasks, or those that require very little editing... Two suggestions that will make this App a 5 star (atleast for me)... 1. Option to copy the entire schedule at once for multiple days.. 2. Although my notifications are on (with vibration), I don't think it's working; so that needs to be fixed Rest all is fine !!",4
8f89b131-7749-4c4b-ab49-fd282b0e8f39,Easy-to-use but what's the fun in that.,4

27b833f1-34fc-470e-9bc0-76d6dcaefdc7,"I really like the app, I do appreciate the free version...so much so that I am considering the upgraded version...I like the color theme...I do wish that the Pop up reminders were a little bit more colorful... maybe interactive would be nice too.",4
d66d72e8-3d50-4d7d-97af-ee7f2b1dc999,"The user interface is gorgeous, looks way better than Google's calendar!! Has several useful functions, only complaint is that there are only 3 colours for the tasks (without the premium) so you'll need to get premium for the full experience. Still the best I've used though, it as some serious potential!!",4
b3237f32-ed7b-47f2-877c-f5887aaf6b95,"The app is pretty good I love the UI, but I would really like to see the tasks scheduled for the day (without timestamps) in a way that I can see their names etc without having to tap them (on top of the calendar day view) Also improving widgets on Android to make them more customizable, for example only showing tasks for the current day, having a month/weekly view etc",4
c9c61d54-b697-4f86-aa80-abc22bf394f1,Good really good,4

52dae61d-b87d-4d39-a7fb-7af57da4b7ae,Clean and practical. Gets the job done despite how simple it is!,4
9a628006-1d00-48f5-9ee4-8f8f2171f1ae,This app is brilliant for organizing your day. It shows how much empty time you still have and lets you set reminders for everything. My only complaint is that it is only for phones. Make a Windows or Mac version and it would be perfect!,4
45c37d15-4251-49ef-b4f7-fba20b193d49,Cool app. One thing I could recommend is to dial the vibrations down when clicking a day. An option to turn it off would be also great,4

c86e1881-acb6-4115-9c09-c5d85c50bdaa,"Super intuitive, and I imagine it will only get better with updates. Better than apple or Google calendar but unfortunately not compatible with computers",4
99b3d70c-7d76-4b49-a54e-47f63a14e656,So far so good. I just wish we could make the text bigger or smaller.,4
68290b5f-56b9-41e5-a418-6d57d836ce03,Can't believe its free! Would love to kofi the devs. Its a simple drag and drop schedule to do list combination. It does bug out occasionally but it is really good otherwise - reminds me of an old app that eventually got taken down (Accomplish - to do list reborn) and Prosper hits the mark. If i could give a very cosmetic suggestion - maybe put the untimed tasks in a side bar that u swipe to see and use.,4
14259671-90ca-4d8e-a79b-78d77acde2f1,I am using it for the last one week and so far it is quite user friendly. Hope the last update will bring more functionality. Keep up the good work.,4
493dc8f8-cd9d-43ae-8051-459967647c29,"Enjoying it so far! Some things I like: -color coding -easy to duplicate tasks -easy to visually read. things I would like to see: -edit one instance of a recurring task -weekly/monthly overview of tasks -ability to add/edit tasks on desktop -widget for todays timeline, to quickly see schedule. Found a few bugs: -inbox tasks- once it fills up the page, not able to scroll down and see all tasks. -If you make a task 0 min, it just deletes the task and I'm not able to find it",4
ce26fb53-2292-4e97-b60a-d9372777e7ea,"A widget would be very much appreciated! Overall it seems like the best task app for students because most of the others I've tried doesn't go well with repeatable tasks. The design is very intuitive- it has everything one would need from a schedule, colour coded tasks, custom reminders, movable tasks and subtasks too!",4
7e3ca0d9-6520-40df-95f5-3a3fb658c0d1,"This app is exactly what I was looking for. The combination of inbox (kind of a to-do list) from where you can schedule tasks into the calendar is simple, but perfect. Intuitive and nice design. The only downside is that it's only a mobile app. Some kind of PC version (standalone or browser app) would make Prosper the perfect productivity tool for me. But I know that takes time and it's not a reason to give this app less than 5 stars :)",4
bb30c694-fd0c-44b9-8137-62a7cf2e0221,"Was a bit skeptical at first because I came across this on reddit, but after installing the app and setting it up, I really like the UI and the simple layout of everything",4

72c8e495-9265-406e-a138-8ac0d6427035,Very awesome app however the calender view needs to be expanded on also the task list needs bit little more features.,4

890152bf-542a-4568-9c3c-f7435ef9398c,"I really like this app. The ability to pick custom colors for each task and to make them repeat on certain days or at certain intervals is very nice. The ability to move tasks around is also very helpful if you don't quite get something done when you planned to. If there were a weekly view with the ability to drag tasks to a different day, that would be really nice too.",4
929fa99f-ceee-4f32-a2d4-b3ed1eeb8576,"So far I like how intuitive it is to make tasks and schedule everything in, very smooth and self explanatory. It would be nice to be able to change how I view the calendar instead just having a scrolling week up top. Sometimes in my planner I'm blocking out chunks of weeks that bleed into the next week and it's easy to just make color blocks so I can read it from space :) otherwise I'm really digging it so far",4

f7a2ee9b-bb6e-4e85-9827-cbeba84473ba,A very minimalist and cool user interface and additionally doesn't require an account to use. Would definitely recommend this to everyone wanting to keep track of every day stuff.,4
