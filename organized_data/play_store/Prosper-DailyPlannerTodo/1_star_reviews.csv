c36826f7-bf05-4371-8743-2033e2eaf0ef,"1. Unresponsive and completely useless widgets. There are only 2 widgets which show you your tasks, they are not categorized, they are not labeled with dates, and you can't do anything with them. Widget just displays some of your tasks, you can't open app via widget, can't add, remove or check tasks in widget. 2. Lack of communication: Emailed developer with some suggestions I believe could improve usability of app by a lot - didn't received any reply. Besides these 2 points app is pretty decent",1

I Know App Provide CSV Data Export in Pro Subscription, I'm not talking about this. I'm taking about restoring the old Data Back when we Reinstall The app..",1
64e7e7f2-744b-408a-944f-ceb14c601a44,"The tasks are not synced between devices, although that's a feature? I also payed Prime for a lifetime and it still says ""Get prime"" (it does not recognize my payment at all). It is a neat App on a tablet, but can be tidious on a smartphone, why there are not the same qol features on both devices is a miracle.... Refunded and uninstalled.",1

506ac408-3551-4c19-bfd9-31ceb06ab9af,"Unnecessarily bloated UI and everything you'd want it to actually do, like allow a home screen widget, is locked behind a subscription service or a ridiculous $30 price to get full access. I can buy a physical planner for $4 at any store, I'll stick with that.",1

0f2ee197-a17f-4837-994b-3ecaf72a1d9e,"This app is garbage. When i first downloaded it was good and i loved the app so i paid for a year sub (thank god i didnt buy it outright for $50). Thats when everything went wrong. I began using recurring events and it was slow, randomly flip between days and i would lose track what week I was on, the start of the day would be blanked out if i had too many events, and generally very chuggy. I tried to contact them about it, and a refund, and have heard nothing back. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP.",1

8271c076-3277-488e-ac52-7a86eb72df64,Google calendar integration doesn't work. Notifications not working. Need to get basic features right before charging. Beta version at best.,1
8c7f5629-395e-4dfb-826d-8668210cd39e,no free widgets for this type of app is a deal breaker,1
4dfd379e-fdea-44aa-b18a-c0c66a68b2f8,Having to pay for something as simple as a weekly reminder is honestly crazy. No reason to use this as a free planner,1
82d19bab-a9e4-466e-b94c-c4d332c6923a,still terrible.,1
65afe2e5-59d6-4edc-bf7b-d26550f5898f,"Yes, it's another 1 star review. For a start this app hasn't got end-to-end encryption meaning the developer(s) and their team has full access to your entries should they desire to poke around your private data. Coupled with 'Data Shared' = Data that may be shared with other companies or organizations: Calendar events. On top of this the, I presume, developer is highly unprofessional in their responses to 1 etc star reviews. Personally I am looking forward to mine, should one come...",1

e2441b01-573d-453a-bfad-e4c13b72d988,This app appeared on my phone without my knowledge. I use google calendar always have. Noticed it scrolling thru apps. It is a pay per item app. Reporting since presence on my phone is highly suspicious.,1
447985f2-4364-4bb3-8e71-a55de184421e,Uninstalled because you need a subscription even to choose colours. The only available colours with free version are red and blue :expressionless_face:,1

8c243d3e-17d6-4380-9b29-cfdfddc76ab2,Every tap in the app is asking for money. Have no idea how the app works and why I need to pay.,1
beebc103-2399-4b52-98bd-2303d250e7d2,"Seems like it would be a useful app but the simple stuff behind the paywall automatically makes it pointless & worse than many free apps out there. Not an expensive sub but why would I pay for something I can get for free elsewhere. Edit: as ever with google reviews, I cannot see developers response. Sorry, cant see what you have responded with",1

0df69f68-7485-4ca0-877f-ae6faa5e9a44,"Nope, No Way, Not happening! I thought that this app would be a cool way of looking at your calendar and any tasks associated with that day. So as I'm going through the setup process and I tap on import calendar button Prosper asks me if I would like the monthly or yearly plan. For an app to ask for money to use what I thought was the primary objective of this app is a show stopper for me!",1
6cd5cdbb-a99d-4040-a294-fa7f2b4752c7,"What is the point of having a ""free"" calendar app that you have to pay for in order to link your Google calendar? :flushed_face: Was really hoping Prosper would be THE calendar and task app, the interface is gorgeous... but as a pretty book with no substance, this app is all glam and no guts! No reason for me to pay for something without at least a trial run!",1
