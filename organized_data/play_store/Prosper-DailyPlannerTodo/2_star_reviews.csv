abb13078-9705-4c03-a8ea-be75d883d4ce,This is for people who live their lives around a calendar. You can't make separate lists or sections. There's no quick add. The animation makes everything slower. You can't click to add details. There's so many extra steps just to do simple things. It's not for people who like efficiency and it's not for people who want to plan projects.,2
abf7ba8a-2d6d-4336-b363-bd44533797d8,Can't use what matters to me the most; widget. I'm not sure if widget customization is available or what it actually looks like. No image is provided here either. I would purchase it only if it offers a nice widget.,2
62ccc729-4393-4402-9e50-d0d50949d51a,"Too many bugs to be useful: Synced GCalendar events can't be deleted (won't sync back). If you delete an event in GCalendar after it was synced to Prosper, it won't get removed from Prosper either :face_with_rolling_eyes: There isn't even a way to manually start the syncing. If you create a recurring task in Prosper, it won't be synced to your calendar at all. Prosper just wants to be it's own app with barebones Calender integrations, but it should be a UI for the existing GCalendar backend instead!",2
39cb3298-509b-467c-82dd-e0734d0273b7,Able to import Google calendar but not sure why my event is duplicated and cannot add events to calendar only can add task. Cannot edit events also. Can only view by week. Widget is not good enough too.,2
430c4964-63e5-485e-ad34-e39ef1b6a89a,"Extremely simple.....& BORING! This app is just very predictable and plain, needs more options and colors and personalizations",2
833a22cf-c246-428c-bbfa-58cba4697e57,"Feature requests: Widget size and padding options, stuff is so unnecessarily huge for me. Breaking a task into multiple time durations, ideally with the ability to span different days. Tags? Make the emoji field searchable. Ability to group into projects or assign different times to different subtasks. Show subtasks in day and widget view.",2
bfff414b-ca22-4267-90ec-c0ebf2517744,extremely visually overwhelming. Honestly if i had the executive functioning to take this on I probably wouldn't even need a scheduler in the first place~,2
6f0c7bc5-ec76-408b-8e63-6800535bc946,The creater(s) are mindful of other people's struggles,2
0e5a756c-fd3f-4382-90ee-0bcd838f3e77,"Recently downloaded, over all App looks good, but whenever I try to purchase the subscription it says something went wrong on our side. The developers better fix this issue to avoid monetary loss. Not happy I can't access the full features even after creating an account with them.",2
d72ff367-88a1-408b-82b8-69b8ab881619,"I guess it's OK. I'm only trying one month at a time before I waste too much money trying it. No trial period, while signing in to Google! It won't let me sign in with Outlook because Outlook says that Prosper is Unverified. I hope it's trustworthy! Also, even after signing in with Google, nothing from my Google calendar or tasks are showing. Thankfully it was only a waste of 2 bucks before finding out import does not work. Canceling after one day. If you have ADD like myself, this isn't cool.",2
6ed30604-99ab-44d5-8ae2-58b658d53ebd,"While I was very excited for this app to be awesome, I was quickly disappointed. I was hoping for alarms to go off for different tasks, but the only thing it offers is a slight beep- you will not hear it from across the room. I've reached out, very politely, asking for a refund. But my many emails have gone unanswered.",2
1860c0d8-11b1-45f1-90b3-6aad97e49240,"أكثر من رائع. بحثت طويلا لكي اجد تطبيقا مثل هذا. Genius app, i searched a lot to find such an app",2
3e36cd80-86d3-4e9a-8a99-293f07db094a,"I could not access ways to add on the calendar. Hence unable to plan ahead. Perhaps tutorial/instructions weren't clear, however clicking on the date or locating + sign were not found. Contacting was inapplicable. Only good thing I saw was I didn't have to sign up before I it wasn't the app for me. It doesn't provide anything in the free version. All you can do is add items for right now. You can't plan ahead.",2
fd6894c9-ecb7-4de6-9406-805bce93b2cd,Doesn't support everyday - tasks.,2
411f5fc6-0f89-4dcd-ba4b-6b9349d61c17,Not very helpful.,2
afb09be3-4e18-4978-ae0f-2e571070a789,"All would be great, except you have ruined my alarm clock feature on my phone. I can no longer access it through the notification panel, I have to find the clock app, go to alarms, then use the features. I don't care if you fix it, I'll be deleting now to ensure full phone usage is normal, then I'll probably forget that you exist. This is a big f up. Don't ruin the phones features to make your program work better. Edit: I'm a very technical person, your app broke my phone's features.",2
cd76af20-e963-4161-95cd-712fd227f8d5,Good looking interface but would be nice if a) you could change the widget appearance ie colours b) you can create a task directly from the widget You call me a troll because I gave an honest assessment? ridiculous I'm not a troll.. I actually paid for one month to see what the widget was like but I have cancelled,2
f79f94fe-b214-43bc-94e4-938cd5f1e4a6,Noice,2
06b06440-62d1-4988-962d-7f147782d9fb,"The interface is good, but there are limited options. The widget does not show the month or day of the month that the task is set for, which makes it useless. The widget also does not have a function to add a task, requiring the user to have to manually open the app to add a task. I paid for the whole year, so I hope that it will improve, but as it is, with no support for Google and the app limitations, it is just a redundant app on my phone and tablet.",2
5126158d-354c-4ad3-ae42-ee288f3819fb,Just started not sure yet.,2
140a95ee-ade2-45a2-a105-005d82e00e93,Don't really like is just a calendario doesnt have no mote features,2
a04b833e-69bb-4f55-bc07-76f8389697d2,"I'm like actually upset tbh. I was really excited to plan everything out, and I really liked all the features it offered... until I saw there was a premium version. Although the pricing is pretty fair, I'm upset about how little you get with the basic version. 3 colors, no reminders, no recurring tasks, no widgets, no statistics, etc. It was honestly disappointing, to say the least. I mean it is functional without premium but just barely. There's not enough detail without having to pay for it..",2
