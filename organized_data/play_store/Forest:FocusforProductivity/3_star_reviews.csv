So it is frustrating to know when the tree has been planted so we can plant the next tree.

Otherwise it induces needless phone usage as one has to start the cycle again and again. This also leads to the tendency of delaying the start of next cycle as well.,3

6b8ccce9-ad32-42ea-8871-06d861afbc88,Maybe I'm using the app wrong but does Forest have an alarm or tone that plays when the timer reaches 0? I have played around with all the settings but my app is always quiet when the countdown is over.,3

For me that aspect of the app definitely pushed me to use it, and I feel like it was falsely advertised. Makes it feel more like a gimmick than actually caring about the environment.",3
7957a56d-4a11-43f2-b2dc-060d6139580b,Use this alot. But I'd like to see a function where you'd be able to pause the timer for bathroom breaks for example. It's pretty annoying having to give up just for a bathroom break.,3

I would appreciate even a small reply so that I know that you guys will be working on it :( Giving a low star rating unless the dev team reply to this message and try to fix the problem.

There are a couple of annoying bugs - particularly if you use the sound function, it can sometimes get stuck 'on' and the ambient sounds (rain etc.) won't stop until you restart your phone, even if you close forest. More annoyingly, a couple of days ago it wiped my entire planting history from several years of use so I can't see anything earlier than two days ago. Very frustrating, especially since I've built up a lot of history on the app and have a pro version. These kind of glitches make it a lot less reliable and are pretty annoying - without them I'd have little to complain about!",3

000f3ee0-2e03-434c-8b2f-5bf14fb92b4d,Why it keeps killing my trees? Hope you fixed it soon.,3
043d4420-632a-40bb-87b0-c0bb8f662915,Here's how it cud be improved :App should have games (5 min) after completing each forest.. games should be different after each forest so that curiosity to reach another forest never ends..1 forest may be equal to 20 trees which means 20*30=600 minutes are spent on work and after that much of hard work u r getting a 5 min interesting game..which can motivate more !!#just a suggestion otherwise app is good,3

3cabfa62-32de-417d-ab78-f812afb742f9,"I love the concept and the design but there are some major issues. The app won't detect other apps without giving it permission to read EVERYTHING that other apps are doing which is a huge security problem. Also this app keeps turning my notification sound and vibration on after each tree grows which is infuriating because I ALWAYS keep all notifications off. Additionally there are some usability problems, like too many taps required from app launch to starting a tree, etc. I want to love it!",3
5ea0bacf-9165-4b56-a57e-ec6e8ca54651,this is such a great idea and i love this app but the longest time my phone screen can stay on is 10 minutes and here i can set the time up to 105 minutes. when my phone locks it's like i left the app and then the tree dies. that's the only problem to me but it is a very nice app :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes::seedling::sunflower:,3

e33b86b7-fe2c-43ef-9f54-10a1da4f88fe,It would be better if you could build upon the same field instead of having to start a empty field every day. In that way you could actually build up a forest and it could be quite motivating seeing all of the work you've done over the past. This simple change for me would be so good can be quite demotivating seeing an empty field every day. So quite like the Focus now version for iOS where you can see all of your tomatoes in one place. Good idea with the different trees would love to have more options.,3

acb7ecb5-372c-4d14-8081-59ebbfe71db0,I put the time for an hour most of the time but if the phone display turns off my tree turns into a little plant again so it starts itself over. It would be very cool if it could just keep running in the background with the display off and when I turn on the screen it goes straight into the app with out it having killed my tree.,3

7f7ea937-1c24-44fb-862e-b863f3a9b52f,The original intention of the app is nice but the idea of just a tree isn't a big attraction to me personally I know there's another app in Chinese it also has the feature of setting reminders for other tasks too hoping you guys would have an update ! Would love to use this app daily later on!,3
14404fb2-ba95-4434-b564-77477b0fd29e,The idea is good but the app allows you to do multitasking with other apps. For instance if you get a Whatsapp Notification you can easily go and check it without affecting your plant. There should be a way to stop this. Also as a suggestion we can integrate it with facebook so as to publish on your wall when you give up or when you actually succeed in your target. This can create a mental pressure to not to give up.,3
7f010e3a-b0f6-47db-8446-1784b1ebe411,So you people really plant the trees every time somebody is successful in app or is it just like a game or challenge?,3

9adbf13a-e55c-4a9d-ad30-e847b70b2c14,"Love this idea. On the surface it's a useful tool. However, in my use so far I found the following difficulties: 1. Settings are unclear -- what does ""Notification"" mean? Turn off notifications? Turn on notifications? App notification? When does it happen? Not clear. 2. I continued to receive external message notifications when a tree was planted -- wish this app could shut all notifications off globally. Even using the ""Mute"" option, the screen still lights up and the notification appears, defeating the purpose of fighting distraction. 3. I was able to press the Home button on my phone and go to the Home screen, open Notifications, etc. -- i.e. leave the app -- without triggering the 'tree kill' as claimed, and then return to the app where the tree was still alive. That's not what I understand it claims to do. Wish this app was more aware of its environment. 4. Once this app mutes sound, it stays muted when you exit the app. Wish it would return the sound to previous state. Easy to forget the phone is muted, otherwise, which is annoying. +3 stars for concept. -2 for issues mentioned.",3

63d655e0-fe4b-48d4-b315-0508af8cffec,I'd be nice to be able to up the tree growing time to 45 minutes or even an hour. Maybe receive bigger/different trees for longer times to encourage that.,3

b0d79059-cdb4-47d6-a8df-e23c1353dd0b,When it force closes it resets the time and it force closes every time you leave the app. So when my phone locks it resets the time. Would give 5 star if it would stop resetting,3
