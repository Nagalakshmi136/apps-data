3d9d9b7c-2445-4f21-9766-97db67bea362,The reason the app is worst:enraged_face: is because due to its new feature that is applied in it the reason that we can only set a timer maximum to 30 min.Only if we are urge to set a timer for 60 to 120 min or even 40 min we are unable to acess it for free of cost.For that they are . continuely showing the icon for paid acces which makes the app much more irritating :enraged_face:this app only want to make money as year before they were providing the facility to set the timer of maximum of 120 min and now it's paid.,1

This discourages use of the Pomodoro method. Claims to be a Pomodoro method app, but penalizes users for using shorter focus sessions by providing loaer quality rewards when compared to doing a 2 hour session without breaks. Requiring people to do long focus timers without breaks to get the best 'reward' actively discourages use of the Pomodoro method.",1

c318d228-21e0-41fa-bbee-d9a233c39ff9,I have decided to edit my review. I once had this app reviewed as 4 stars but after the new update my opinion has drastically changed. They make you pay to have more than 2 sessions of focusing a day. Essentially you are paying to not use your phone. It was fine when you had unlimited sessions as you could get lots of studying done and keep track of how long you had studied. Sad to see such a good app become useless.,1

And to pay premium to plnt real trees is a feel good way to buyg their product and it takes 3 days of studying to plant a tree. Yes I paid premium.

The timer was 10-15 minutes (unchangeable) and you're incentivized to look at it once the timer ends to grow another plant. Want a plant that's not a bush? You'll have to log hundreds of hours. Also the app has way too many ads. Normally I would not say that in a review because I can tolerate ads but this was exceptionally bad. I can't recommend this app to anyone.,1
