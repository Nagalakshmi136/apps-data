But now it forces you to do pro version only as I can't seem to understand how to start the focus button now that part is hidden by how the 'unlock pro version' pop up.

Now, i can't set the timer over 60 minutes without asking me to pay. 120 minutes was available for free before, and you could earn nicer trees when the timer was set to 120 minutes.

One of the suggestions was to update google play, and it's possible that happened automatically in the month in between tries.

She travels to different countries (in app) but that isn't available on android. I also had to uninstall reinstall the app and lost all of coins and progress which you can only save that type of stuff anyways if you buy the pro version which seems like a ridiculous feature to pay for. That wouldn't be a big deal except coins on the android version are very hard to get. To unlock the second tree you have to grow 23hrs minimum. If you watch ads the number cuts down to 12.5. Once again though on the apple version you have none of these problems which is incredibly frustrating you guys cant make the app half as good on one platform as the other.,2

There seem to be a few static images of the plant, 1 per growth stage -- so the plant starts off at the first stage, shows no change or movement or any signs of life for a long time (eg. 15 mins), then suddenly skips to the next stage, at which point it again just sits there without moving for a long time, etc. Because of this, you see no dynamic change or growth, the plant does not feel real and it did not feel like a big deal to ""kill"" this super fake unchanging plant.",2

In all honesty it's a shame I get that the developers need to profit but was it not enough beforehand when the payed extras weren't necessary to the app itself?",2

Now they're all 500 gold each and the prices increases with every tree/bush you buy. This makes it basically impossible to get new trees now no matter how much you study. The only way you can possibly even get your third tree/bush is to watch their ads they give you for double gold which is their entire motive with this cashgrab push. I'm dissapointed.,2
