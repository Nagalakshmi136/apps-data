2b5aa44e-dcb3-4737-9c84-e95c6ee0db1c,I have to scratch my head reading some of these reviews. People saying how much the app has helped them or that they've used it for *years* and then giving it a low star rating because this feature or that is locked behind a 'paywall'.

One issue I found is that, the recent update has removed the ability to customize the break time after the focus session, which is a step back. Now the break period is the preset option in the setting which takes away the ability to manage your break sessions depending on the focus sessions, it would be appreciated if the ability to chose the break time spontaneously is restored, thanks.",4

Considering I could barely focus on my homework for 5 mins b4. It won't let you use any other apps when you're working unless you have the pro version and you enable certain apps to be usable while focusing.

I end up doing either 120 minutes with no app blocking (so Im not focused), or 20 minutes with breaks, so I can't grow complete trees.

Only issue with the app is that there's no option for different time methods. It can only be done in blocks of time and while yes, you can manually set timers its gets annoying if you use a 'time block' style study technique (like pommodoro), as you cant even pause the stopwatch.

7797979d-2d88-49f9-ac7a-4867a67f3095,I recently downloaded forest app again. I like the option turn on and turn off deep focus mode and recording extended time in the timer too. I would prefer if there was an option to choose between 12 hour clock and 24 hour clock to track time though. I would appreciate if it would be possible set it in the free version as well because I can't afford paid version right now. I absolutely love the flexibility to set the timer and using stop watch too.,4

But I would really appreciate if you modified the feature 'deep focus' I really wish there was smth which would stop me from giving up just because I wanna scroll on my phone so I sometimes give up easily and that why I have a few withered trees.So please add some features like 'super deep focus' where I cannot give up and everytime I open my phone, this app will automatically open so I keep my phone away for ATLEAST SOMETIME.

Please, remove the ""are you sure you want (...)"" dialog box when i want to stop a stopwatch session or at least make a toggle setting for it.

What I mean is, I know the whole point is to get you off your phone and help you be more productive, but I only really would need an app like this to help me focus on art cause I get distracted a lot, and my art program happens to be on my phone so I can't plant a tree and then just go to it. Otherwise, it's a cool app and works well for me, just a suggestion :)",4

Besides, the developers could've made a wider range of trees, for example, I use forest a lot to focus, by it, I earn too many coins and I am able to buy all trees in no time.

15563e46-027e-43d3-afb4-5c224f4e388d,this is a really good app. but the reason I gave only 4 stars is we don't have an option to go to the gallery without giving up on our focus journey. most of the times now our notes are in the phone no. however I enjoyed this app a lot and it really really helped me to focus,4

Sure I can understand why the other features are locked behind a paywall but having to buy the pro version just to make an account and sync my data? That kind of sounds ridiculous. I feel like it would at least be 4/5 stars IF you guys can make account creation available to every user.",4

It is also great that planting real trees is achieavable for all. It is a shame that you cannot delete or edit records when you forget that your tree is still growing or when you procrastinate. It's possible to delete a record, but it costs more money than planting it, which is demotivating. I hope this issue gets addeessed. Also real trees are ourchased by same $ as game ones",4

c66443ab-d304-46cb-b290-ebc720de8eed,"Excellent for focus. Once you set a time period to focus over it ""grows trees"", and very effectively blocks the target apps by overlaying the app UI so you can't see it. To get out of the focus time you need to kill the trees that are growing. It's strange but it works, you feel really reluctant to do that. One feature I'd like it to do is scheduled blocking, i.e. working hours, with the ability to defer for a short period with no consequence so it isn't overly rigid.",4

Please consider adding pictures of the trees that the users dedicated their time and energy to plant in the real world.,4

0a56cdaf-f53c-4159-af35-d32bf46a8823,I don't ever rate apps but I really like this one. I have pretty bad ADHD and it makes it hard for me to sit down and study or do homework. I get distracted easily and don't feel like I really accomplish anything. But Forest really helps me stay on track by locking me out of apps and I get to actually see my hard work through my cute little forest. The pro version is definitely worth it (its only like $3) and I love all of the cute trees and flowers. :),4

5780fc9c-7937-44e9-8eec-533f3c89d2d6,A really good way to track your time while doing tasks. The concept of gamification of time management means it provides a fun quotient to the tasks that I'm tracking. I could also view my progress in the form of a forest that is really intuitive. One thing I'd have liked to see was custom tags on the free version. That would have made tracking progress even simpler and intuitive. Also sometimes it doesn't notify when a task is completed which can be frustrating.,4

5aff8c0a-e70b-4dc1-bd88-432058be2c91,It's a pretty nice app with a really good concept and psychology to help you focus for a desired time. It is literally a perfect productivity app and deserves a 5-star rating. The only another feature i would expect is a sound reminder when a break gets over. Otherwise the app is way better than any other productivity timer app out there.,4

I tried looking for it on my app settings on android and i tried to find it in the settings on the app itself but failed. Even read through FAQs but couldn't find info there but eventually found it somehow. Will update my rating after a few weeks or months of use.,4

Would be amazing to have the function where we can message people in the app to organise forest room sessions. Would also be good to have permanent forest study rooms that sends a notification to people in the room when a study session is about to start and so we can organise groups featuring our goals/hobbies and to talk to people general. I hope there are also more frequent opportunities to purchase trees!,4

Edit: I find it unfair that there's a global list of people where the leaders each week are obviously click farmers. Using Forest on one's phone for constantly 24/7 with a 2 hour max limit each time sounds a bit counterproductive considering an app fighting phone addiction. You should make local leader lists like other apps.",4

Please add timetables to keep track and set how we want to spend our time ... Otherwise , SUPERB . Edit 1 :Also i know this kind of is against the purpose of timers , but maybe add a chance to add trees after the the ay is over like if we forgot to record one session , maybe without addin it to leaderboard. Amazing app guyz",4

However, the fact that it doesn't vibrate when it finishes is annoying because I have to make the notification sound louder and it gets distracting. Also, most of the users here are students, and I'm sure only a handful can actually pay for the pro. I truly hope you can add more features to the free version because it is not that easy for a student to pay. For example, more trees available, login and sync.",4

0dbb1f75-76f6-4185-8c88-b05671610692,So far really good. This app really gives motivation. I wish the trees had much more differences with the time duration. It would have been encouraging to set for longer time. Even different sizes will do. Also it would have been nice if same tree had more than 4 varieties. Now 10 min and 50 min gives the same tree. By the way.. a banana tree can only have one bunch of bananas. Coming from a place with lot of banana trees it was funny to see a banana tree with two bunches of bananas:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,4

Maybe have advanced app allowed settings so I can set which apps to allow depending on which category I chose. Ex. Journaling category I could allow pinterest but study category wouldn't allow it.

It isn't like other pomodoro apps like To-do focus who really limit your experience by making it all paid.

501815cc-68d8-48a7-b224-0f3ec72031c6,Great app helps stay focused and makes it fun. Beautiful design! My pro version planted a few trees already. Development areas: if there would be a navigation guide to be easily accessed for 1st time users. To my mind quite a few auto-phrases sounded like dismissive orders vs. being inspirational. No ring or buzz once the timer is off. It would be helpful to have the auto suggestion for the quick break once the timer is off vs. trying to search for that within the menu. Low variety of plants.,4

I don't regret buying the premium version for a second. Also, it is a lot easier to earn coins if you are an Android user, because for a three hours task you can get 130 coins if you choose to watch an ad. I have unlocked every single regular tree in the scope of a few months. And I love the timer mode. The only drawback so far for me is that you can't pause the timer.",4

""Give Up"" and ""Check out why you Failed"" aren't exactly motivational to keep me going during a rough day - especially when I need to open a messaging app for a family emergency. ""Stop"" would have been fine. I also wasn't fond of how important information was happily placed behind a pay wall - a cheap $2 wall, but it didn't say if Pro is a one-time purchase or subscription.",4

I have only one gripe, and I have an idea for a solution to it: As someone who works and studies in 45-minute sessions, I feel that the app discourages me from using it to its full potential, by keeping advanced stages of multi-stage trees out of reach. Potential solution: perhaps let us work on the evolution of a single tree over multiple sessions? I wouldn't mind taking a longer time to grow more beautiful forests. Setting that gripe aside, the app seems great.",4

Love this app.. but the only problem is that I have to unlock the premium version to unlock some of the trees etc.. but the fact that this app is helping to plant more trees around the world is just awsome. Global warming is a real thing and our plant is slowing dying. This this helps bring awareness to that. Love this app. Overall it is great.,4

Honestly, I'm not sure if this has been overstated or not, but having a platform driven by consumers would be amazing.

Plant with friends - one gets distracted, everyone has a whithered tree. 2. The app notices when you use another app and whithers your tree. It has built-in notification forgiveness (no penalty for something you didn't initiate) and a customizable list of apps that you ""Allow"" yourself to access. Note: came back to rate this again. The bug that was annoying me is fixed.",4

Gain coins by planting trees and focusing. The deep focus mode is very useful, and the system of tree planting and tree withering is fantastic. I have a very short attention span and this is possible the only app that allowed me to score high on my tests. You can buy music packs and different trees with coins.

The app in itself is really nice but it would have been better if the allow list feature was free. That's the only thing I would like to have in addition. For school work u need certain apps so those could be kept in the list. U can use other apps if the deep focus mode is not on but u know how social media is. You are bound to open them.

I like this app so I buy the pro version, I hope the developer can create and update this app not only adding the variety of the tree but also the other aspects. Since the plant ground cannot be changed (green grass and brown soil) and the theme of the app just green I think it's kinda boring to see this all day. I suggest the new update can change the theme app and the plant ground to seasonal or fantasy place. Edit: Thanks for granting my wish, I love it!",4

6f7b7714-2b41-41b1-9eca-7392debc03ec,I purchased the pro version last month. I think everything is great just the price of the tree is a little bit too expensive? Another thing is that maybe you can extend the focus time to more than 2 hours? So can focus for a long time at one go.,4

This was okay for a moment..But most of the time whenever I want to unlock various species or sounds the APP FREEZES.says this app stoped.so.. frustating...But this is a nice app those who are ed fed up with making timetables and those who want an motivation.

I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.,4

Cons: Initially there is very very little choice of changing type of trees and music, also there must be options to atleast add your own music and the least liked part is related to the availability of highest possible time(it's limited to only two hours).

The deep mode is well crafted. Kudos to the minds behind this app. My only suggest would be the back button used once the tree is planted. That button looks more like an email button to reply. Changing that would surely not make a big difference but it'll be more pleasing to view things in unison.,4

bd347b86-4d6c-471d-b1d2-65d71a0a4ade,Hi there again. Thanks for considering my earlier feedback for future development. Another one that i wish this app has (and the other similar app i used on ipad has) is to have the short break and long break (and we can assign how many work sessions we need to have prior to long break). And then the ability to assign different tunes and notice tone for the different category (work/short break / long break). i decided to use another app on my android for the time being but will revisit in future,4

Although an extremely important drawback, which is the app's blessing and curse, is the mechanism of killing the tree when you exit the app and open another. This idea fits perfectly in the concept of the app when a social media platform is activated but it's rather frustrating when the only thing you want to do is look up something on the internet or use Google translator. I suggest an update where the app generates an application checklist.",4

I didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case I actually needed to use it for something important, but I don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff. Also I like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get. It makes me more motivated to use the app. I hope they add more season-themed trees (snow covered would be cool!)",4

b71236c6-42d7-4a4a-9404-251abee20cd7,its one of the best app for focusing....but after planting the real tree...if the app sends photos of the tree then it would be very satisfying to look at and also we have to pay again for the ios app too which can be free if u have already paid for android version . so these are the 2 suggestions i have...if this gets implemented then it would be very fine for a 5 star rating. thank you.,4

af36db9e-fe20-4877-aa51-8681a5fe6b00,Really effective in getting me to focus more. My only complaint is that the number of virtual coins needed for certain things. It seems odd that bushes cost the same as trees to unlock when bushes give you so many less coins.,4

Only took off one star because android users with smart watches (mine is Garmin) will find that whilst the app is in use their watch buzzes continuously due to the way the notification is set, the phone detects it as a notification per second and so the watch buzzes once per second.

The UI is cute and easy to navigate, and the 'plant tree' feature always successfully motivates me to keep using this app. I love it, I would have given it 5 stars, if it's not for the issue about sound notification. You see, I like to use this app as podomoro timer too, seeing as how it has features for that.

That important task came in 3months ago as I was preparing for an exam and it has been helping me focus a lot as I study and as I was listening during review. The trees were also a lot of help for positive reinforcement, it was rewarding to see a beautiful garden after a hard day's work! At first I hated the fact that the trees got more expensive along the way but as I got into the habit, it actually motivated me to focus more so I will be able to afford them! I have a suggestion: can you have a break time option? I plant trees during my 5-20min breaktime as well because I really want to beautify my garden! Lol. But I'm not able to use my phone, obviously. So, maybe consider planting options for breaks as well?",4

The simple threat of killing the tree when you try to navigate away from Forest is enough to stop me from getting distracted - a marvellous idea! I find the records to be helpful also, and it's always pleasant to see an orchard grow over the course of a day's work. Also, other user complaints that Forest breaks when their phone goes off, or breaks when they receive a message and try to reply should really look at the whitelist option. Takes some fiddling with, but it solves the issue. Any one star reviews remarking on this are invalid. I have one complaint - the recent update seems to have broken Forest on my device. Now, when I activate a timer and let my phone screen turn off, Forest automatically closes. Unlocking my phone takes me to my home screen and not to forest. I receive a notification telling me that it has crashed. When I open the app back up the tree is still there, counting down, but sometimes it will crash for good, leaving me with withered trees. Hope this gets fixed in a future update as this app is the 'trees knees'. Haw haw haw.",4

bf7b6316-50f1-4cf6-baa0-9bde3a474f38,"I like the app because it helps me limit my distractions and resist the temptation to waste time on my phone. However, sometimes I get a call while my tree is growing, and the call kills my tree even though I did not pick up the phone, which is rather unpleaseant. Additionally, sometimes I will get a very important message that I need to respond to, but I cannot because Forest will threaten to kill my tree if I leave the app, which can be inconvenient. I suggest allowing a ""pause"" feature for these types of situations where a disturbance is quite important. Now, I understand that people may take advantage of the pause feature, thus ruining the very purpose of the app. This is why I suggest a limited number of pauses, likely one or two allowed per day or per week. That way, people with an important call will not kill their trees, and people likely would not abuse the pause feature if they knew they only had one. Otherwise, the app is fairly simple and very useful, and I am mostly satisfied with its performance, thank you.",4

I'm sure a lot of others can agree with me. I think the dev team is super friendly and open to suggestions, so I hope this gets added in the future.

Does the reward system differ between the default trees and bushes and the special ones? I have this concern because I am trying to save enough coins to plant a real tree. But I also love the designs of the other species. However, I am hesitating to spend any coins on species because it might not a good investment; I want to plant as many real trees as I can and I think users shouldn't have to deal with this opportunity cost. So do the other species earn more money or give other benefits? If not, can you consider implementing benefits?",4

Not so sure how others react to the idea of being guilted into saving a tree, but the idea of having to sacrifice a plant to my irresponsibility was horrifying.

c4543224-f545-45f6-b129-76d2ed956079,I have only just started using this app and so far it seems fine. My only problem is that I can't seem to amend the amount of time I want to focus for. I set 45 mins but would like to adjust that.,4
89797f68-a140-4bf0-bd31-89031d6c317c,The way you programmed this app was cool..... I have started studying in order to grow the trees..... quite creative..... very interesting and very nice.... hats off!!!!!:OK_hand::OK_hand::OK_hand:,4
7c5504b4-a731-4391-ae79-182fc008b97c,"Achievement, pretty icons and planting a REAL TREE are great incentives. Fun and easy to use. Well invested money. Only thing missing is something like a reminder or the option to add some min per day that surely happened but were not tracked - after all the purpose of this app is to get you OFF the phone.",4
bef6de4d-72f7-4b87-a342-29e2b1b561d1,"I really enjoyed using Forest prior to the last few updates. The newer versions are simply geared toward the developer making money. It seems like they lowered the amount of coins you got per tree so they could push the option to buy boosters. I was also forced to delete a my old data in order for the new updates to work. EDIT: Even with the newest update I still think it's gone downhill. You won't notice unless you've had the app for 6+ months, but the amount of ads has increased significantly along with the options to buy stuff. It's almost comical seeing ads for Munchkin Match on an app used to help you stay focused.",4

I used to struggle doing even 2hrs of work everyday and now I'm doing a lot more!! Forest is really really great! Some suggestions though for improvement would probably be the ability to use the whitelist apps because I still don't rlly know how or and am not really able to use that function, adding more tree species and maybe introducing animals that roam the forests you grow which you can buy with coins?",4

All of the new features added to this app are so useful and improve the experience immensely. I've been using it nonstop recently. The only few things I'd like to see improved on are more bushes that match the trees, and possibly also more moving bushes/trees? It's weird to me that only the rose bush moves, why not also the water that comes out of the octopus tree? Also, it's a bit strange to me that the bushes are the same size as the trees. Overall though, I'm glad that I'm able to re-experience the excitement I felt when I first found this app in its early stages.",4

The two things that I would really like to see going forward are (1) push notifications when your work time or break is over. Its really easy to get lost in a ""5-minute"" break if there's nothing to warn you that it's over. The same thing goes for the work time, I'd like to have a notification that I completed my time. (2) I would love to have some sort of widget for my home screen for this app. Maybe a representation of how many trees I've planted, how much time I've spent focusing today, or something else similar.

There was a persistent notification that told you how much time you had left to grow your tree 2. When you went to a forbidden app, your phone would vibrate and you would have a few seconds before your tree died to save it.

It's a creative way to keep on track, make sure I take breaks, and see how much time I've been working (or slacking off). Not having to see my tree whither is a surprisingly powerful motivator for me to not abandon a session. I love seeing my little forest at the end of the day, and I look forward to being able to cash in my points for different trees--or even better, real trees somewhere on Earth. Only thing I haven't figured out is how to edit a past entry. One time I had it set to keep timing after the ding, but I didn't realize it just keeps going until you click something, so it logged a bunch of time I wasn't actually working. Another thing is that I think you only get to plant real trees if you purchase the paid app. It was only $1.99, and of course eliminates ads as well, so not a big deal, but good to know in advance. You do, however, have to cash in 2500 points to plant a real tree, which takes quite a while to get to (the formula for how they calculate points earned is complex) and any points you spend to get different trees and bushes (500 points each) comes out of the same pot, so you have to decide between getting that cute little cherry blossom (or octopus topiary) and putting much-needed oxygen on Earth. Granted, you could decide to plant trees in your own yard or donate real money to to the organization for every so many minutes you worked, but it's just something to know.",4

The only complaint for me is the leaderboard. You'll never be able to get the leader board achievements (and accordingly, the coins) without cheating apparently, because most people just use the app all the time and pile up ~10k minutes per week which means they've been running it 24/7. I wouldn't care much about that if it wasn't for the fact that you need the achievements to get the coins to unlock new trees since regular tree planting gives you hardly any coins as reward. So please either fix the leader board or reward regular planting properly.

It's an added motivational effect if you're actively getting a reward (other than good grades I guess) for spending a set amount of time concentrating, but it helps you more to also take breaks (both mentally and physically). So while I was fine with staying focused, this app helped me remember to take a turn around the room, get more water, take a bathroom break, etc. The reward of a tree you sort of created is very stimulating.

My only criticism is that to gain the awesome looking trees, you need to have set the timer to 2 hours.

You set the list of apps you want to block, set the timer and forget it. No more options to think about. - the user interface - there's something about growing trees that is both addictive and fulfilling at the same time. Even if they're virtual ones. - real trees - what I perhaps enjoy the most is the real trees that you can help plant when you've reached significant milestone in your focus time. That's like a big double win - you've stayed focused and got some real good work done. *and* at the same time have also made the world a better place in a tiny way.",4

In a future update I'd like to see an ability to expand the forest as you earn more privelidges, and I can't work out how to use some of the controls where you set the timer to either sport/study/reading etc, so that could be made easier.

5978f270-2fab-4717-a470-d5aa934a0708,"I love the concept. I've tried so many motivational and productivity apps, but most others are either so overly involved that I end up getting distracted by the workings of the app itself or so rigid that it makes me feel stressed if I don't do everything and do everything perfect. This app is different for me because it gently pushes you to do better and to focus as long as I plan to without overbearing expectations. The forest will loke nicer with a balance rather than with either extreme. I love the whitelist option, too. You can make it so you only block out games and fun stuff while keeping your calendars and timers free to use. Great. Terrific customization options, too. It isn't necessary to pay money for it, and I didn't pay anything for several weeks, but this was the first app I've ever loved enough to go out of my way to buy a google play card to get premium so I could link up with the computer and ensure that a phone switch won't erase my large forests. Consistancy was my main goal with any app and that's exactly what it's helped me achieve, so they deserve at least a dollar or two for excellence. Also, if what you really are looking at this app for is the feature that locks out other apps to be able to put the phone down for some sleep, there's an app for that by the same developers called Sleep Town. It's more aggressive with its push for premium, but I'd still suggest it since they're both a great tag team app combo.",4

I do have some feedback though that I think would continue to improve a already excellent app. - with the new ""watch an ap to double your coins"" I often get an error where it says ""the video is trying to load"" and it never will - we need some more cool bushes! The new trees are excellent and totally worth working towards but I personally don't find many of the bushes super appealing (just a bit boring) - I think if would be cool if there was a function that rewards you for extra time you don't spend using your phone! I often study longer than then time I'll put in, when I turn on my Phoebe get a quick peak at how long the timer has been running for *past* when my tree grew, it would be really cool if the system rewarded coins for this extra time as well. Just an idea :) Great app that has been super helpful!",4

717cf2bd-3467-42b9-b027-269effd90406,At first I thought the trees withering away when using the Whitelist option didn't work. I was using lots of apps and the tree would still live. Then I carefully went through the whitelist and realized it was allowing a lot of apps that it shouldn't (I didn't mark them to be allowed). Unchecking those did the trick. The only other thing I hate is that the notification options are either none or vibrate. I can't have just a sound notification without the vibrate. Every time the phone vibrates it startles me. It can actually make me Jump and make my heart race fast. If I could have just the Chime sound as an option that's all I need.,4

It's always helped me stay focused and off my phone, and browser, when I really need to focus on my daily life. I agree that if there were daily targets (if possible, set by the user) to meet and gain a greater boost in seed count that would be quite an addictive addition and inspire me to use it everyday since I often use it when I remember. However, the current awards for Google is also helpful. My LARGEST complaint is that I purchased the tag overview addition to track how much time I allot to my specified tags but they do not differentiate each activity I have set as a tag. For example, my ""work"" ""exercise"" and ""rest"" are all blue on the pie chart despite having different percentages, in comparison to my green ""study"" tag that is green. It's the only different color tag against the blue so I find it redundant to have the feature if it can't differentiate between all of the tags users have set.

b6dcdca8-f989-415b-9a4f-ad2b28d70a7f,It is a good app and makes you very productive. However the developer's should create an alarm system where the app automatically grows a tree as soon as the certain time has been reached. For example: At 10pm I shouldn't be on my phone as I need to sleep. So as soon as 10pm comes around a tree will automatically start to grow.,4

So you feel like you're doing good for the environment too while being productive.,4

First, it sometimes doesn't detect you using other apps which is one of primary functions of the app. Secondly, I managed to get all the trees in no time. Would appreciate of the developer would care to add more of em :)",4

194f5b8e-b2c7-4506-9c46-8991e67d6926,This app is really useful and neat! It really helps me stay on task without wasting my time. The only thing I wish you could do is let a tree grow even more after you've grown it a little bit. For example when you set it to grow for 30 minutes than you complete it. It would be nice if you could go back later and have another 30 minutes so the tree would look like it would if it had been for 60 minutes!,4

The interface is good and it fulfills the purpose, but only if you're determined to leave your phone and focus on your work. The limitation that I feel this App has is that the costly trees does not give more coins than the primary Pine. So, I don't see a need to buy any other tree, but you can not spend your seeds on anything else, so eventually, you will have to buy. P.S. Thanks guys for fixing the vibration problem with the new update. Really appreciate it.",4

7b6612ae-f3ff-48ac-9237-34fe80f0ea5c,"Love the app with one minor complaint: at the end of a session it sets my device to vibrate. This means that unless I remember to reset my notification volume after EVERY SESSION, then I wont hear when the following session will be complete (because the phone was automatically set to vibrate the previous session) I can set the notification to vibrate to remedy this, but I still have to reset my volume afterwards for other notifications.

The problem is, I can't lock my phone without killing the tree, and it wastes the battery. That's pretty much my only complaint!

ca3363fa-602b-4cc4-a544-360dc297539d,"Great idea and great app! The only recommendation I have is that you make it so that if you exit out of the app in any circumstance, the tree will die. I am able to click my home screen button and keep the app running. I think if I am unable to use the phone other than to grow my tree, I would be much more productive.",4
a837e215-1fd7-4501-9bd0-54fb115db025,I love this app; it indeed helps you stay focused. I only wish there were different settings for the timer.,4
8e0350b1-f4a1-4452-9b0e-294cc596ed4c,I've been using this app this week and I like it more than using a standard timer because I am penalized if I'm tempted to check my phone. I don't want to kill the trees! My only problem is that you can only set half hour time frames. It's not flexible enough for me. Maybe you can add a 15 min option where you get a sapling or bushes or flowers. My classes last an hour and 15 and I turn this app on during those times. It would be really handy if I could get the app to run during those last 15 minutes.,4
b2bb82d2-48c8-4689-88a7-21e1b6d561e9,"Very good idea and excellent implementation, the UI design is really well done. It would be awesome and even more motivating if it could show your monthly forest, and possibly different types of trees?",4
83576ea1-19a5-4611-8776-25839d3163f4,"I like it a lot because it helps me during both homework, and I like to set it during classes to stay focused. The only thing is that it would be good if the times were slightly more variable, like having 20 min increments as well (my classes are 50min long). The little trees provide very good motivation though!",4
1928101d-d889-4722-8058-a53603e975c9,"It's a great app, and it really works! It would be fun if instead of just planting one kind of tree it said ""plant seed"" and then different flowers, trees and bushes could come up! And perhaps a ""have you gotten them all - list"".",4

fdca4220-b407-48e7-8a9f-99ed647d22b6,"I love this app! It really keeps me motivated to stay focused! I only wish that I could leave notes about my trees. For example, it would be great if I could title one ""Studied Ch. 1"" or ""Did English Homework"" & then be able to tap one and see that title, so I could also keep track of what I've done. Will give 5 stars if that happens. Otherwise, a perfect app!",4

09d8dd23-8165-4989-baf7-40c3485dad97,This app always saves me in my exam times. When I showed this to my friends they downloaded it and tried but they say that they mostly give up. Maybe because it's just a plant. My SUGGESTION is to make another app which has some pet like a dog out cat. I'm sure no one would dare to kill an animal.,4
f2eaf6fd-d14c-4d82-ad1b-b52c12272523,"This app has been really helpful in keeping me focused and giving me 30min chunks to do work in. I especially get a kick out of populating the little forest with trees. Unfortunately, it appears to have a bug that will randomly restart - or delay - the timer when coming back from the screen sleep mode. Just now I had two minutes left, but when the screen faded and I swiped to get it back, suddenly it was back at 29 minutes. That has been the most dramatic instance of the bug; other times it has jumped from 19min to 27, 20 to 25, etc. Could this be fixed? I really like it otherwise.",4
3ba47c85-f9ed-4913-b883-e636d380673c,"I hope there will be different trees for collecting. The longer people stay away from their phone, the rarer trees they can get. And add a handbook for showing all the trees we've seen. This app will be much more interesting!",4

b8291331-ed2e-4043-ba20-5bd344fdf2a4,"Nice fun app. It works well and I love the design. Just two things I wish it had - the ability to compete with friends like a lot of exercise apps do and sound notifications when time is up (maybe customizable sounds). I've gone over my time and wished I could have kept logging my progress. If it made a loud sound and asked me, ""Do you want more time?"" would be good. Also I don't like that I can't see anything from last week. It should show my progress over days, weeks, months years and milestones markers.",4
