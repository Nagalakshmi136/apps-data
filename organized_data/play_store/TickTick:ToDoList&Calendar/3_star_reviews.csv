6ee0d12c-6dbb-4649-9905-4bd7c4a11485,First touch functionality didnt work. But now seems to work. But what is missing is that there is no time estimates shown in the wearOS app. So if you planned your day by setting time estimates in the mobile app and then want to use the timer/countdown functionality of the wearOS app then you have a problem because you will have no idea on how long to set the timer in the wearOS app. So pls show time estimates in wearOS app. Als would be to start directly a timer by clicking on task.,3

Of course, that specific task would have a reminder but it's better if the tags themselves can be used in that way, too. Like #MondayWork or #MondayPersonal.

Inbox and location based reminders are great but the calendar, labels, and subtasks (add due dates and reminders to the checklist) are more important.",3

By the way, instead of having a specific due date, can there be a feature so that the task is due to finish within a period of time eg. to be completed sometime this week or sometime this month?",3

The web sync and ability to access in any browser is great, and the interface in both the browser and the Android app on my Galaxy Tab is smooth. The web sync and reminders without a paid subscription are the must-have features this app does right. What keeps me from giving this a higher rating are a few missing features: 1) Ability to set a user-specified default reminder time, such as ""8 am tomorrow"" -- right now you have to add a reminder manually with each task, and edit it if you change the due date. It could be so much more efficient. 2) Ability to hide specified tasks until due. 3) Option to add tasks to calendar. Without these, this app is almost there but not quite.",3

E.g.: ""Task 1"" repeats every monday and i'm behind several month, the task was last due June 10 (Today ist Aug 13). If I complete the task today, the new task should schedule for June 17, but the new task ist dated August 19.",3

Can't drag up and have list scroll, so end up doing dragging in Android app, which does much better. Wish I could group lists like with Astrid. Wish I could indent tasks under one another, or at least drag a task onto another to make it a subtask. Have to manually create subtask now. Not clear if a task can be in more than one list--looks like not.",3
8bea097a-0eed-42fb-98f1-55f91905bd4a,There's no tags or the possibility of assign one task to different folders. That would do a big difference. Thanks,3
