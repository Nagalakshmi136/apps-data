6ee0d12c-6dbb-4649-9905-4bd7c4a11485,First touch functionality didnt work. But now seems to work. But what is missing is that there is no time estimates shown in the wearOS app. So if you planned your day by setting time estimates in the mobile app and then want to use the timer/countdown functionality of the wearOS app then you have a problem because you will have no idea on how long to set the timer in the wearOS app. So pls show time estimates in wearOS app. Als would be to start directly a timer by clicking on task.,3

For example, if we are to name tags based on what day it is like Monday or Tuesday, it will remind us on that date. Of course, that specific task would have a reminder but it's better if the tags themselves can be used in that way, too. Like #MondayWork or #MondayPersonal. When it alarms, the #MondayWork would show the list of tasks in an order we arranged tasks. Just my two cents.",3

You can get more subscription / clients by following the strategies adobted by LastPass and Spotify by giving more in Free Tier which willingly force users to subscribe. I am still checking the app as a free and find it usefull in comparison with AnyDo but still not good as Todoist. Need little bit polish up and more functions.,3
6d92570a-69e0-48c6-a84b-bc53dacbaa48,"I noticed a slight anomaly in the app. If you start focus for a subtask e.g. SubtaskX of TaskX, then why isn't that focus time added to the total time of TaskX? That SubtaskX does fall under the TaskX, so any time invested in SubTaskX should also be added into the main TaskX otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of SubTaskX if it is independent of the TaskX. I hope you will 'focus' on this issue. Thanks. ‚óèEdit1: The app has a lot of useful features but they are often hard to find. Simplify it.",3

2e2931af-e272-4aef-a9c0-60ec63852f4e,Good overall. Needs a button to clear all completed tasks and a monthly subscription is outrageous. A single fee makes much more sense for an app like this.,3

I wish I had the option to turn that off while keeping the settings to play a sound or vibrate when I get a task to do. Update: I've gotten used to the layout and love how I have more customization for setting intervals for reminders.

It took me a week to understand how everything works and where all the features are. Some, like the calendar view, I never got to use. On my PC the buttons are small and not well visible, and it is quite difficult to figure out how to input the time and category of a task at the input bar. * I was thrilled to find out (which took me way too much time) that it is possible to print the lists. Great! Now how about tweaking the printing settings so that the list won't be so ugly? place it in the center of the page, frame and add proper margins, font, header... * and so on.

There are too many missing features, too many new bug reports, and the server is slow if you have over 1000 tasks. Also, they make it too hard to group select tasks and standard features like ""select all"" or ""select all in this category"" are missing. Also you have to complete tasks before you can mass-delete them. All these limitations have work-arounds, but there shouldn't have to be. The main use would be if Google Tasks and/or GTasks utterly fails, then in a pinch you could use TickTick to rescue your task info, bearing in mind that Google / Gtasks' nested sub-tasks feature is not supported in TickTick!

The Web application is clean, efficient and browser independent -- unlike Any.do. I'm still new to Tick Tick and may provide more input later.
