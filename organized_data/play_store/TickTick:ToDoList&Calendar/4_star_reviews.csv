d21bac7d-f1bd-4160-9d9a-17a531b6ae0e,"I've checked several Todo apps and this one IMHO is the best. Habits, pomodoro timer, tags, etc. And unlike some other apps it has had START DATES from the very beginning. Another well known app is just now implementing this and not in a very intuitive way. If having multi day tasks/ projects is important to you, this trumps the others by far. Bonus it also has a wear OS companion app that comes in handy. Every few years I check out the competition's features and I ALWAYS return to this. A+",4

I would give five stars — but I'm deducting one because of their wearOS app, because it doesn't let me add anything; it only shows a black screen when I hit the plus button.

As a student I had a lot of tasks to do, So downloading this was absolutely helpful. What I'd like to suggest is that you guys (the developers) create designs for the app. The design is a bit boring.

63346869-7fa8-41b9-a8cc-dd8336784611,App has all the features you would want. It's designed so it feels intuitive. Plenty of info and support on Reddit and YouTube if you have a question. The free version offers a lot. For extra integration with google calendar the paid version is very reasonably priced -- about the same as a paper planner. Cannot reccomend enough.,4
9d0a1183-a30f-4bf2-adb3-944428ace0f7,Good app. Very comfortable and easy interface. Helps to modify tasks as per requirement. Helps me to increase my productivity. Would be more beneficial if they update and add sliding notes features to switch between different notes.,4

I want an app that handles tasks, planning, time logging, and goal tracking, and TickTick has an answer to all of those. You can even customize which tabs to have! My only gripes would be that some UI widgets are kind of duplicated, and although the premium subscription is a good deal, I don't want to invest data that might be stuck behind it.

This goes far beyond app capabilities. Think more along the lines of, what folders would I need? What lists do I need I each of those folders? Are the lists called the same thing in both folders? Do I need to use the priority feature or just assign dates to my tasks? Why do I need tags? Without a system, every task app will fail.",4

A feature i would love to have is being able to share a folder with one or more other people. Everyone who is sharing the folder could then add items or click that it is done without seeing everything else in my account.

Due to my own discipline, I have had periods where I used this daily and periods (months) where I didn't open the App. When I am using the App, I work better, I feel more in control, & I accomplish more of my priorities. Over a decade ago I used Outlook Tasks constantly. The only feature where TickTick does not meet the old Outlook task is that TickTick is designed to have a single date associated with a task (called a due date). I use the Due Date as a ""start date"". TickTick is less flexible in building special reports based on both start date and end date for a task. I think of tasks always as having a start and an end. When you use the ""duration"" in the paid for version, it is still complicated as TickTick does not provide easy ways to create custom reports and smartlists using StartDate and EndDate. Other than that, this is a fantastic app that allows you to create ""lists"" of tasks (I use as ""Projects""), have a 4 level priority system which I no, low, medium and high priority but I use as ""low-medium priority"" (no !), High Priority (!), TODAY (!!) and NOW (!!!). This way I can easily signal what one to three tasks I am working on Right Now when I get disrupted with another call it is easy to redirect myself. Great app. I gladly pay for it so they can continue to support the app and improve it - and I get the value out of the app. I have looked around for better todo list apps multiple times and never found anything better short of going fully back to Outlook to manage my emails and calendar which I do not plan to do.",4

c191ddbe-0aee-4e14-ac39-d5286a67dc5f,"Since joining their very affordable monthly subscription, I've found TickTick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine, and it's actually helping me be more productive even though I'm a pretty begrudging procrastinator. First off, the widgets. God, I love the widgets! The first thing I see after unlocking my phone is A) a list of all the stuff I need to be doing on that given day; and B) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that I need to also make time for. This was what I found was missing back when I used the ToDoIst app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. I suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. The widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the PC and web integrations. This was a ""must-have"" feature, because I've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them ""refreshed"" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. TickTick makes everything instant, to the point that a TickTick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. I really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what I'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. This also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. I've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually ""take over"" the entire screen, at which point I can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. There's a few areas I can see for quality-of-life improvements, though I'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the ""final"" iteration of this app for some time yet. A few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- To mark a habit as ""incomplete"", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'X' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. It's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your ""failures"" at all. It makes me wonder if there's other useful features I've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end UI + widgets. -- It would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end UI had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on ""streak"" for. You can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. I'd probably be more motivated to ""keep the streak going"" with a given habit if I could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --Also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. By which I mean, when I pull up my habits for Thursdayy, for instance, and I see ""exercise at gym"" in my list of habits for that day, then surely I should get some indication of ""you've been to the gym X times this week so far, and you have Y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]"". Again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. Maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, ADHD-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. But all in all, these are minor foibles. Fantastic app. 5/5.",4

Lastly, I want to mark (sub)tasks as NOT COMPLETE if I know I didn't complete a task but I don't want it showing up as overdue. Summary formatting for this would remain the same.",4

Resets to third day following every time the habit is marked as done. 2) Track a habit less frequently than once per week e.g. once every two months.

It also has projects and tags that can be colour-coded. But the big issue for me is the filters, which don't let you filter on repeating tasks or future dates (except for up to 60 days in the future).

One downside I have found is that the app is at first hard to navigate and it can be difficult to understand all the functions. Perhaps a small guide would help.,4

I've being using this app for almost a week now after trying all kind of planners for several months. What really hooked me into this app are the habit management since I have quite a bunch of daily habits and I like to have everything together so Ticktick really got a point here. The thing is that the habit tracker is way too simple and when I need to check in something past midnight it get annoying, there isn't a way to change the reset time. Also I used to count how many glasses of water I drink, but I can't really do it with one slide so I had to open 8 habits just to drink water which is also something you guys could work around. One last thing is that I think the widgets on android really need a rework they're not really pretty and again nothing for habit tracking, nothing for podomoro and the weekly widget could be redesigned. Otherwise I really love your app, especially the left and right swipe shortcut which saves me lots of time. Great work keep going !",4

It is severely let down by poor synchronisation with Google tasks (too slow or forget it) which limits its usefulness where syncing with other applications is a concern.

It does not push notify changes to lists. If add, complete, change, or comment on a task in a shared list, the other member(s) would not know until they opened the list and looked for new items.

Also, the language parsing is only available in quick add. I'd like to use it in normal add too as when you remember to adjust the way you write to fit the quirky parsing system, (like the poor 24hr time handling) it works quite well and saves time. The calendar view idea is nice though and works well which is a definite advantage over Todoist along with the way it receives emails forwarded to it but the android calendar view still lacks zoom control which was recently added to the iOS version.

Batch add of tasks like gtask , it was awesome please include this feature in ticktick too... Ability to convert sub tasks into tasks and vice versa, it should make everything so flexible... Ability to assign some kind of default sort order like by priority etc just like you provide""new task defaults"", currently everything is sorted by custom, it's difficult for user like me who prefers priority as default order... 4 priorities is excellent, can you provide urgent field too which should be placed right above all the priorities in the list... When you see all tasks of a folder, only option is to see them sorted by date, why not provide secondary view like priority, in which main tasks are sorted by list and each list is sorted by priority internally...",4

Had been searching for quite a while for a very good To-Do list app, and this one ""ticked"" all the boxes ;) However, I upgraded to Premium for the fact that you can do a ""Smart List"", and then I realized that the widget for this smart list does not work correctly - and this is quite disappointing, hence my 4-star rating. To be more specific on the issue: I did a smart filter with the options: 'High Priority' OR 'Today'. Then I chose the widget ""Badge"" and for the setting ""Show undone count for list"" I chose this Smart List that I just described. I had 3 High Prority items in this list and 2 items due today and so I expected to see the number 5 on the widget Badge - however to my surprise, the number on the screen was only 2 (only the Today items were considered). This is something that I could have done WITHOUT the Premium version, so I felt as if there's no benefit in this regard for me being a premium user. Fix this and I will update my rating to 5 stars and remain on Premium :)",4

My suggestions: 1- I really like Today's planner, but it should ask for the duration and default day/time can be customized. Also I like to have a week planner too 2 - Calendar week/day view should be improved (calendar in web portal is superb, you can try to do same features). For example, rescheduling by drag/drop is very hard and no duration setting. I would love to have 'Arrange Tasks' features here. I use it to plan my week. 3- when estimated pomo entered duration of the task can be set automatically and the progress can be tracked on the go 4- there is a small BUG as well. when the duration is set to default duration (i.e. 1 hour), the duration becomes 0 for that event in the ics feed.

The built-in timer makes it hard to go back to other apps.

One reason I'm taking off one star is for two things. First, I wish Tick Tick supported themes or would give users the option to change the color scheme. Right now there are two and I'm not a huge fan of either, but prefer the light theme. Second, location reminds are great, but why can't I set them through the Chrome app?

I can tick off each subtask, and when they're all done it actually recognises that the task is complete, reschedules it, and resets all the subtasks to not done (you have no idea how many other apps don't do that). Add to that the simple and pleasing interface, easy task entry, flexible due date and recurrence, and good range of integrations, then this is one of the best.

The cloud service and web tasks in particular is pretty nice. Sync is fast and the interface is clean. Requests: Better theming options for the widget?

The most important : - Choose if the task must be repeated from a due date or on a completion date - The assignment of tasks (so no reminder for me, but for the assigned) And also : - Choose how long the task must be repeated - Time to spend for the task and timer I hope these features will be added soon, but except this, the app is very friendly and useful, so I recommend it for those who miss Astrid !",4
65a9b6ce-6bf5-4b1e-8bf5-e2dd56a09cfd,Initially had some syncing problem's that were resolved by the developer. Great app.,4
472194f7-cbde-4a0e-87b9-d82c18411ca0,"We tried many todo apps since Astrid, and felt we'd never find one as good. Now we like TickTick a lot more than Astrid. It seems to have been better thought out and just seems easier to use. Hope it doesn't get complicated as they add new features.",4
004b9577-5d7e-4e2f-864f-3ee5b7f6c738,"Simple to use. Easy to set new events. Only downside is if you accidentally ""complete""a recurring task, you can't undo it. Or if you can I haven't figured out how",4
fa82f52e-b977-42e2-81a3-360efc356d1f,This app is pretty much everything I need in a to do list app. The only things that would make this app absolutely perfect are multiple size widgets so I can have more than 1 list on a page and more priority options.,4
f4b0eb6f-81a3-4b91-bb8d-59cb59e692e8,"Great overall functions with syncing. ""Clear All Completed"" would be a great addition for the next version.",4
23fd9ba8-e50e-43ce-a064-51c756077c1c,"Got so feed up with Wunderlist and its shocking syncing. This is just what I was after. Simple & reliable on Android, iOS & the desktop. One small request - the ability to add multiple tasks to a list, with a single click after each one (rather than clicking to go back to the task list then clicking again for a new task, or having to click once for the options menu then clicking again for 'save & new').",4
eba238a2-41b9-4fc4-9a7a-3db03b8852b2,In Astrid you could hide tasks until due date or until specified days before due date. This helped in showing a small task list as only those tasks that were currently due or would shortly fall due were shown,4
984a60c5-b03d-4841-b2d6-07fa8f356743,"Better than Astrid. Lightweight and easy. Less feature is plus side (not being bloated). One minus, the plus sign on notification doesn't bring up anything.",4
56bb17cf-9443-4a73-a909-fa8a22f2e486,"Great on many essentials. Widget has quick task add and checkoff. All new tasks go to your inbox until you move them. Very GTD friendly. Another huge bonus is, it's not popular and not blocked at my job. This the only app my office doesn't block which is huge! Only downside is that you can only have one category for each task. But I still gave it a 5 because it's so much better on other dimensions.",4
77eb4a35-d3fd-4d74-88f3-095928484f2d,"OMG, the ability to have your Google Calendar events show up with tasks that have due dates is amazing! Also, adding tasks to lists is easy (needs batch add like GTasks though), and you can move or assign new due dates to multiple tasks by selecting them. The web app lets you drag and drop too. Syncs WAY FASTER than Wunderlist. Plenty of task and list sort/view options. Needs a dark theme. Would like to be able to collapse the left list panel, but I can live with it.",4
cbd25eec-8e3b-4578-a74e-ecbb475310c0,"4/5 just because features are missing. What is already implemented, it's excellent Pros: - beautful and minimalistic web and android app; - responsive interfaces (both web and especially the android app) -no google integration,..yes for me it's a minus I always found this as a sync nightmare in other apps using google; -great support; - fair price for pro version; Cons: - collaboration features missing: notifications, assign individual tasks, comments, etc. In this stage it's not a collaboration tool. - the slick look takes it's toll on the visual guidance: very discreet(read difficult) use of lists/tasks colors, not enough task information in the task list; - not enough use of the swipe gesture functions: either use it to open left panel of use it to edit individual tasks; Please implement the collaboration features so I can start paying.",4
80f4afc4-2b88-4a86-88ac-885af7c8795e,"The others are great as well just not as simple as Astrid. I like 'Wunderlist' yet to small and UI is okay, I like 'Do task' yet not enough color coordination and the list goes on. This is exactly the precise app to Astrid as a replacement. TWO HUGE RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) More star colors that are ranging from yellow to red to blue etc based on tentative, important, very important. 2) Reminder alarm for different times, days or weeks etc i.e 15 mins or 1 day before alarm reminders. Thanks.",4
aea6600b-729b-451b-88bf-ce666e9293d9,"This does not sync with Google Tasks, but here's a workaround. - install Gtasks (made by the same developer) - open Gtasks and it will load your Google Tasks - import Gtasks into TickTick - uninstall Gtasks - As I recall, this may not import your recurring settings, so you will need to set those again in TickTick on your tasks. But it will import in all your Google tasks and lists.",4
fbcfb85a-310e-4f7e-999a-6e388ee254a9,"I found this app because I tried the few suggested apps that Astrid mentioned in their closing down message and I found that this was the one that kept the simple but efficient design that I liked so much. My only suggestion would be that when creating a different color for a list, that it shows on the whole length of the item instead of just a tiny bit on the side",4
18b0c079-8e90-492f-8288-1dd79870564c,"Like 4 million others, I'm an Astrid refugee. VERY heavy user of Astrid. I've tried about a billion replacements and admit there are several that probably meet many people's needs. Not mine. They all have gaps that I don't think I can tolerate. TickTick is the best one, and doesn't have any major gaps that are showstoppers for me. I'm going with TickTick as my Astrid replacement--am suggesting some features to them (similar to Astrid's) to really make it great but this is a good Astrid replacement.",4
8850df1b-9a61-495d-8b2a-fb6fc6a58c44,"Why did you make this app when you already have Gtasks, they're almost identical from what I can tell. Love it so far though. EDIT: thanks for reply! Looking forward to future process, this is the only todo app I've enjoyed since I'd settled on Astrid",4
952a8306-ac1e-4662-8271-15cd0d1e6443,"However, the only option for displaying the time is in the 24-hour format. Give us the option to display it in the 12-hour format. Also, provide one field for the task name and a separate one for notes. Finally, a dark theme would be nice.",4
b43cf18d-c47d-4af9-a250-3fcf7cf9ba3d,"I've tried about six different task apps and then found Astrid. I loved it for its ability to sync online, interface, and prioritizing ability. Ticktick seems to have all this and be able to subtask but only in the online beta version (something I couldn't find on other apps) so possibly make this available on the mobile app as well. I think the interface and app design is very user friendly and not cluttered. Additional capabilities? - be able to add timed tasks to a calendar. I like this because I can see if I actually have time for a task -- I think there is an option on the online beta for adding subtasks or notes to the tasks but you can't add both. It would be nice to be able to add both.",4
