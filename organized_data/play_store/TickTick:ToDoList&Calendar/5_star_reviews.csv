I have tried most of all the other todo apps like most people I was searching for ""the perfect app"" highly recommend and don't know how I lived without it for so long.

It has a lot of functionalities which other apps may have individually, but TickTick collects several functions like Time-Blocking, Calendar, To-Do List, Habit Tracker, Pomodoro Stopwatch (customizable) & more, and puts them into one app, which is very rare to find. I'm very happy for using this app for so long & without a doubt, you should try it out! :thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:",5

Gotta write it all down! P.S. to the Devs: I would LOVE to have more widgets that are adjustable. I prefer having a 4x1 or 3x2, instead of filling the whole page with one list. Specifically the Eisenhower matrix could scale down a bit more, and the Compact widget should have a ""pages"" option. I hope one of you passes this down! Thanks",5

I set it up as a widget on my phone so when I open my phone all I see is the app widget with tasks that I need to complete for the day. Helps me not to miss any deadline or task.

I am really glad if you have more scales for the priority one, in order to have a precised priority for each task. Another thing I recommend you to change is the am/pm button is hard to touch because they are kinda close together and I couldn't see the changes after touching the am/pm button, so it's really good if you make an effect or something to indicate that I've touch am/pm button already.

I've used it for about 5 years and there have been a few bumps where permissions on Android kept it from notifying me but this was due to updates with Android and it was corrected quickly. The interface for putting in dates and times is a little tricky but once you get the hang off it, it just works and is very functional. I couldn't find anything else that compared. I use it daily.

0df95907-384a-4385-817a-a7b585b58349,My favourite out of all the apps I've tried! The city themes are incredibly pretty and I love the amount of complexity you can use when setting and scheduling tasks. I LOVE THE TEMPLATES!! Makes the app so much easier to use! The notebooks feature sets it apart and is wholly appreciated!. One issue is that i constantly accidentally add tasks to others as subtasks whilst trying to select and move them which ends up wiping their data and is very annoying,5

ab334372-afbd-4f4c-b80f-287ef9fd5cae,"I would definitely say this is one of the best apps for boosting your productivity. It helps me to plan my schedule for a day. That way we can prioritise our tasks. It gives us remainders which was really helpful for me. The app also looks nice and also we have the freedom to choose from a variety of themes. All together, it's a great app in this segment",5
ccb7bc71-f250-4b6a-aafb-76f3cb789142,"Great! It's super quick and easy to add new tasks to my list so I can get back to them when I've got the time. I've got categories for tasks and my shopping list are in sections so I know which stores I intend to buy things from. The habit tracking is nice and simple. The repeat function for things like how many cups of water I've drank each day is handy! The pomodoro feature could use an upgrade, it's hard to tell how many I've done or how long there is until a long break while using it.",5
eeebd1a8-dc10-4c22-928e-97f921de6d44,TickTick is a great app. Even without paying for premium. The amount of absolute joy this app gives me makes me contemplate paying for premium.

Has a great desktop companion app. Todoist is the only one that comes close to this one when we're comparing the to-do's and GTD apps in the marketplace.

Needed something with a home screen widget and desktop version for work, and a big selling point for me is that you can hide features you don't need or have. Tired of companies trying to shove premium features down my throat. This app is very simple-faced. Also love tiny features like turning your lists into a kanban view!

de13d8a2-0ad5-4ec4-89fe-d0a7fdbad8fe,"So, I am rating this app 5 stars for the following reasons: the free features are intense. They give you a lot for free and only charge for features for the high end organizers. I rarely purchase/subscribe to any app, however I had to with this one. It actually works. Sometimes if you have a question (if you can't find it in the help section) they take a few days to respond, however they do. There are a few bugs that need to be fixed but not enough to interrupt your life. Overall great app!!!",5

I don't earn much but I'm considering paying for a yearly subscription. Totally worth it. Also, the free app has tons of features and is still better than all other productivity apps.

It's so customisable, I really love how you can not only set exact times and dates, you can then get those reminders to repeat however you want - do you want to be reminded every second Wednesday of the month? No problem. Do you want reminders only during weekdays? Sure! Also, my love for this app has grown considerably since I found out you can set location based reminders - and you don't even have to pay for it! Fantastic app, A++",5

It has completely changed the way I structure my days and has been a God send to be honest. Now I am much more organised and am not forgetting to do important tasks or putting things off. So long as you remember to jot down anything important while its fresh in your mind and check in regularly you shouldn't ever miss an appointment again especially with the convenient reminders it sends you.,5

И не только. Записываю все: от встреч с людьми и будильников для разных дел (очень помогает напоминалка, которую можно поставить за любое необходимое вам время, я же ставлю обычно за несколько часов, дней и недель до задачи) до напоминалок дней рождения, которые можно синхронизировать с гугл календарем, что очень удобно.

f7223358-ae21-4233-a81b-440ee1d27ac2,"So glad I found this. I have been using Toodldo for years and putting up without subtasks because they are part of the paid version. Also this tool is well designed and only presents me with the fields I use regularly. The less important ones (eg priority) are down at the bottom. And lists and folders! Yay! I put my work stuff in one folder and home stuff in the other so while I'm working, I'm not distracted by the stuff that needs to be done when I finish. Oh and pomodoro alarms too. Yup. This tool has all I need to get organized and focused! Well done developers!",5

e55dd178-4baa-41ab-b9ea-a914b5aac5e4,"I love, really love, this app. I think it's worth mentioning that I'm extremely picky about how I organize everything that is digital- if it's not all in one place and intuitive, it's not worth my time. This app is excellent because it combines tasks, reminders, calendars, tags, and priorities. It's easy and beautiful, and it has so many wonderful premium features. I particularly like the smart lists, themes, and functionality of the app AND the web version! They're both great. However, if you're picky like me and need color coding to be a part of your calendar, then this app isn't for you. It has everything else I need except that! Without color coding my calendar, my burdensome amount of events becomes difficult to distinguish at a glance. Anyway, I love the app, it's great, definitely worth paying for premium if you don't need a color coded calendar. If you do, and you're not super picky, maybe only use this app for to-dos? Since I am and need everything in one spot, it's back to Google Calendar for me. P.S. Developers- great work, thank you so much, please let me know if you add color coding!! I know it seems small but it makes a big difference to me since my calendar can get so crowded.",5

8970829e-9055-4cd3-aaa4-7d2a909769c5,"Best to-do app on the market! (And I have tried many) My favorite feature is that if you have multiple lines of text, you just copy and paste it into the 'add' bar, and it asks you if you would like to make them multiple tasks! Furthermore, it automatically adds time information that you put in your tasks (like '5 pm - eat a vegetable), and this works with the aformentioned trick too. (5 pm - eat vegetable 6 pm - do a dance) So I just copy and paste my entire schedule from Onenote and there it is - that's usually all I need to do.",5

The widgets are customisable enough that you can actually make them look good on your home screen. I subscribed to premium to use the third party calendar integration and this app is now functions as my calendar and to-do list. The premium pricing is fair and unlocks a heap of nice features that aren't required to enjoy the app, but really add to it. The integrated pomo system has honestly changed the way I work and made me more productive and healthy by using the 5 minute breaks to do quick exercises. This means I'm more motivated and focused when I work because I know a short break is only 25 minutes away. The app doesn't really explain what pomo is though so I'd recommend a quick Google to understand it. There's so much more I could say but this review is getting long.

It's smart UI building, and let's me arrange my tasks now that I know my day's flow.

ac3fb738-1b44-40a9-ad25-b2f19b494ccc,Simply the best. I tried a lot of to-do lists that try to follow the GTD method. Wunderlist Evernote Google Tasks todoist remember the milk Etc. The developers are very responsive and they are the creators of the Android app gtasks which was extremely versatile. I think you can add tasks from any medium you want using tick tick whether it's email or web from any OS and any phone. Another important feature that is somewhat unique is the ability to Auto reschedule and also if you have a task that you do every 30 days such as medication pickup then you can have it configured so that it's not spaced out 30 days automatically but it rescheduled itself 30 days out or 25 days whatever from when you actually complete the task which I found is a pretty hard feature to get. This feature was actually added because of user feedback which just shows that the belt and team is an ace! :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:. Note I do pay 4 the premium version even though I'm a cheap ass. Also which is a biggie for Android are the widgets which are excellent! Without a good widget any reference app is useless IMO.,5

Likewise it also has the usual priority setting which I use for concentration peak and dips, you can have sub tasks, attachments, I can send my Gmail emails to it and it drops into my to do list inbox folder where I can rename it and put it the the correct folder.

6ff9456f-ddc6-4197-bc07-2a9a83f01248,In absolute love with the amount of power and reach TickTick enables me to have. Am a Pro user and honestly think its worth it but would like to tell things I'd love wunderlist to get: 1. A desktop app for windows/mac (currently only google chrome app/extension available and isn't great) 2. AN AMOLED black theme is a must and more interface customizing. Genuinely think this feature is gng to have users switch to ticktick or upgrade to pro bc its the ultimate freedom. 3. checklist availability on widget - it currently will show the checklist name as a task rather than the subparts 4. should be an option to make list/folder label next to task name visible at all times or another indicator of which list its from. first review I've written in a long time so believe me when i tell you i cherish this app,5

Time picking UI is just great, alarm-like notifications is also great (indeed, I would like to have real ringtone alarm as well as notification, not just short audio signal). Thanks you guys for your amazing work. Things that I would like to improve: In addition to any time-value —see remaining time for future events and passed time for past events (including task's comments thread). Web app: again, I would happy to see clear timestamps WITH additional info, but not additional info (eg. ""just now"") instead of timestamp, like it is done in comments thread. Feature I would like to have is ""canceled"" button for any task. Check mark is not enough to understand if task is done or became not relevant. Wish you the best of luck. Thanks.",5

I've tried a number of the more well known apps (Todoist, Any.do, Keep, etc.) and while many of these have the same features as TickTick or even more, none of them is as simple to use, as clearly organized. TickTick has one feature that many other apps unfortunately lack (though it's still an experimental plugin): task duplication. This has allowed me to reuse old tasks, and set up templates for stuff that comes back every once in a while, like a packing list for trips. The Wear integration is fantastic! I can pull up today's tasks when I want, get notifications, read task details, check off tasks or subtasks one by one, and enter new items by voice command. It comes on pretty much any platform. I also heavily use the web interface. I subscribed to Pro for a couple of bucks so I could use the calendar view to organise my tasks. TickTick has pretty much helped me organize and to some degree automate my life. I can't express how much better it feels to have everything that ever needs to get done out of my head and into one place. It really takes a load off your mind.",5

f822d865-c77e-4941-a0d5-fe36a54ce017,"Great task list manager. I had used Astrid for several years on my mobile phones until they sold out and were no longer updating and synching across platforms. From there I went to GTasks, which was ok, but still not all that I wanted in a task manager. One feature missing from GTasks was the ability to set different levels of priority. It was either high, or standard with no levels in between. And when synched with my calendar widget, all the text from GTasks was the same color, that I wouldn't know if it was low or high priority. So I recently upgraded my phone and decided to give Tick Tick a trial run. It solves the problems I was having with GTasks. Since I left Astrid, this is the best task manager I've found that does everything I want it to. Great job! My one question for Appest Inc. is will they come out with a Windows 8 app that can synch my tasks across platforms? I did download the Google Chrome App, but it would be handy to have the app accessible when I am using the Metro side of Windows 8.",5

00b2a10a-2eca-4267-82bf-6793f6cd725d,I have a note2 and often clip out context pertaining to tasks or ideas. Could you add sharing files to tasks? And for tasks with checklists a colored progress line would be helpful beneath the task motivating completion. Great work!,5

1c3b4625-0dda-42d4-8152-0a25c62a16a9,I was looking for a cross platform option and trying many tasks management apps available including wunderlist. This is the best I have come across so far. This is simple and has all features of gtasks. I would like to see a better way to set reminders though; something like learn from my previous tasks and set the default reminders on new tasks or have an option to specify a default reminder. Currently I have to set reminder every time I create a new tasks.,5

056332c1-3323-4db3-8690-e160ddc043e2,This is an awesome app! I use it to keep track of homework assignments and tests. My only request would be that the name of the day a task is due on is visible in the widgets. Using a name a number makes it much easier to picture when the task is due.,5
7addb298-15e0-4200-8128-3427440053bb,I need voice reminders! Astrid would use Androids built in voice system and LITERALLY tell me what task was do. I need that!,5
e3fd7c53-ca89-455e-8c5e-c2efaac1bc8e,I've been searching a long time for a way to put down a brainstorm list of ALL that needs to be done in an app that then allows you to assign each item to a category and prioritize as I wish. If i need to view a business list...done. If i need to see a particular date of to-do's...done. If I need to view it all...done. Thank you. It's perfect. Add a tutorial for first time users is my only suggestion.,5
18082725-fdb9-43da-9006-9a5e9de5d43e,"This is my favorite pick for replacing Astrid. It's a simple ToDo app that does what it is supposed to, and stays out of the way. Importing Astrid tasks was very simple (see Settings>More). Still getting to know this app. So far so good. Here is what I like so far: * Calendar view when setting due dates. * Ability to add a checklist under a task. * As far as I know, no ads. * Notifications on status bar or pop-up or both. * Priority levels (2). * Option to display undone tasks in a scrollable notification in the 'pull-down' notification panel. * Sharing tasks or lists. * Multiple widget options (I haven't tried). Here are some suggestions: * Add more priority levels. * Display icon on status bar for scrollable undone tasks. Right now, if I don't pull down the notification panel, there is no way to remind me that there are undone tasks. * Display a note icon next to tasks that have notes. Right now, unless I open a task, I do not know if a task has additional notes or checklist. * Option for assigning custom notifications (ringtone/pop-up/status bar) for each task/list.",5
66f02b61-4fca-4b55-9080-3490527b9a59,This app is simple and just works. I also love the fact there is a chrome extension. That was key in choosing an Astrid replacement.,5
02b34f58-71d5-4c91-b51e-10df4bf4c8e3,Didn't think gtasks could be better...I was wrong. I was sick of the terrible web interface of Google tasks and dev recommended this as a result. Love it so far! I second the others asking for the 2x2 widget!,5
afc8e571-e6b9-4b25-b395-8e72b0e9799d,I gave this a go after reading about it on reddit. I am pleasantly surprised - the interface is very clean and yet is sophisticated enough for semi-demanding users. It has subtasks for complex projects which is a must. It has great sync with a similarly clean webapp and chrome extension. So far I am finding it awesome. Also supports persistent notifications to easily add a new task from anywhere and and the latest due task. It is very well thought out and I hope they can maintain this.,5
cf20b980-dde0-468a-bd8d-5f200d67e136,I founs this app after usinf Gtasks forever as its made by the same people. Great app! I have an obsession with to do lists and thus have tried literally every one above 3 stars in the Play store. This one is definitely simple but has evrrythinf you need 5 stars!,5
346eaefd-6541-4a64-9819-dc8daf153de9,"I tried a bunch of other to-do apps, and this was the best one. My wife (iphone) and I use it - easy to share a group with her. I have one request - if the tasks could show up in my calendar (doesn't have to sync to Google tasks, but if a date assigned to task, having it show up on my Google calendar would be awesome!)",5

26ba8d75-7cc2-4b6e-bffe-2a01402c1fd5,"This app is near perfect. The note/list format is genius and works very well for GTD, better than any app I've seen. Loved GTasks, but this app is much better because it can do needed things that GTasks can't because of Google limitations, and it does so while keeping the app simple. Well done!",5
