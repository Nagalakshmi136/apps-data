I create a new list for each day, but have to delete lists because of the limit in the free version. But starting to day I can no longer delete lists. Also, after performing the operation to delete a specific list I can no longer access that list in 'Manage Lists & Tags' even though it is still visible and counts toward the list limit. I restarted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled the app to try it with a clean slate, but the error still persists. It is as if part of the program sees the list as being deleted but other parts do not. I'm afraid I will not be able to use TickTick as long as the error exists. Update: Thanks for the reply.

Next 7 days doesn't show overdue or no date tasks, today doesn't show no date, but inbox shows things 6 months away. Custom sorting (how many days in the future do I want, should overdue be shown, should no date be shown, which lists would be included, etc) would make this usable. Location reminders are cool, checklists work well, date & recurrence UX is nice, but without that sorting I can't recommend it.",2

It looks like you're the same company that makes the the GTasks: To-Do List & Task List app, so I wonder why you're not able to keep the same features in this application.

Each app has some significant omission, lots of flair, or an expensive robust suite. My needs are few and simple. Astrid hit it, and Tick Tick is almost there. Like the Franklin Covey philosophy, I lead my life by importance (priority) ahead of urgency (due date). So please give me 3 or 4 priority levels. Sort tasks by priority, then due date within priority. Separate work tasks from personal tasks. Sync to a web site that does the same. That's it. No repeating, no sharing tasks, no flair. One convenient shortcut would be allowing default values for new tasks - priority, due date, category/list.",2

What I feel Ticktick is really missing is the possibility to set a time for starting/completing the task and a different user alarm to inform in advance that the task is to be undertaken. Example: if I have a meeting, say, at 4pm, I would like to have an alarm, user customizable, to go off ahead of the scheduled meeting, to give me opportunity to prepare and reach the meeting venue. Other missing feature ? Weekly and daily summary by email. SMS alert. Nice feature ? The subtask function, very simple and fast !",2

This was a problem that even Astrid used to suffer from, but a few months ago, they nailed it! I think they switched to using Android Cloud to Device Messaging. If TickTick gets that right, I'm sold!
