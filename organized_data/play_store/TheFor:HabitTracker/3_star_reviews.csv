c42bd0b0-72f1-49e2-a8d1-971de1b6f2ae,"This app has the same basic feature as every other habit app in the play store, but overall it is slightly less convenient to log your habits, and the overview is limited to a week, and can only view a longer timeline by opening individual habits. Features are pretty bare bones. App includes one widget which again shows up to one week of tracking.",3

71e0d906-d72a-497b-a6c8-67fc6f1286a1,The app is great and has potential but I don't like that it doesn't send me reminders for the habits I've put in even though I've clearly set reminders for them on the app. It defeats the whole purpose of the app for me cuz I'd need the constant reminders to finally make the habit stick and it's not doing that. Hopefully they fix this problem.,3

2729453a-d0cb-4445-891e-8c840b68ba3d,best app for habit tracking. I want the journal feature so bad but I can't afford it rn :disappointed_face:. just a pro tip: why don't u replace dots by smilies? or like give us a feature where we can use an emoji to depict how we felt that day on a calendar. this can even help diagnose depression by telling us how long we have been feeling sad. otherwise best app. go for it. no annoying ads and user friendly interface :slightly_smiling_face::upside-down_face:,3

b819a011-f698-44c2-830c-251a24888ec0,Very complex and tracking the activities or habits is not easy. Would prefer if the weekly or monthly statistics is date wise instead of dots.,3

108c738e-5607-41b5-8acd-b4f20e2be061,"I like the app a lot and it works well for how my brain works. Problem is, it stopped sending me notifications when I travelled to a different timezone. Then it never started again once I came back. I tried to delete and reinstall but it didn't work and the settings all show notifications activated. So I'm unsure",3

732514a9-dc4f-480b-8076-3733d5120f71,Pros : Good & minimal Ui Smooth experience Cons : Widgets are not working in samsung & boringss too. I have tried many apps and I would say there are many things you can do.,3
71f6dc44-8df8-45c0-808b-637ab6c3c4db,I prefer it to have a simple and short name in the launcher instead of a long name that includes explanations.,3

e7ed6bc2-72d6-43e1-8642-7012ff55f176,It is a nice app.But it would be better if there was an option of selecting the 'Start Date' of a particular habit.Otherwise it is a simple and good app.,3

e90010a6-093e-4a96-9521-f4c30a416fab,Love the app but I've tried to subscribe to the pro version. It says I now have a monthly subscription but nothing is unlocked. Boo! --- I was asked to update to see if that would fix the problem. It did! Thanks!,3
5771f7d8-e39a-4535-beab-67f6c35f3d01,"Widgets don't get updated based on System theme, i.e. Dark and Light. It remains Dark all the time. Also, if Widget opacity is exactly white or black, it will be better to read it.",3

bbed1207-7357-4bc2-9ed7-40fdf2c669e4,"Please add option to skip. Also the behavior that makes it so that it auto fills in days (that the habit wasn't set up for) for the week if you've filled in what's needed for the week is nice. It's good that it makes it semi filled in as an indicator, but I wish there was an option to change the opacity to make the difference more noticable than it currently is. Or perhaps the option to hide the unnecessary days would also be good.",3

834bebbe-0c89-4300-b844-45cc422fad9c,Cool app but it would be nice if there was a dark mode and if there were a widgets option for the homescreen. Otherwise I like it. It's minimalist and simple.,3
a357eda8-a08b-4d91-b5a7-751153dc1d22,Overall app is good but we cannot switch from light mode to dark mode through settings. Light mode and dark mode depends on the phone. If your phone settings is set to dark the app is also in dark mode. Would have been much more better if we can change light and dark mode settings.,3
c9e04bd4-edb9-48f5-8cdb-b261ad22c1d7,The app is minimal and beautifully designed. A daily notification to remind the user to mark habits would make it great.,3
