ade159ad-e8e7-49ed-98ed-9e2099654dd5,"I love the UI and its functionalities! but the color picker is really buggy. it reverts to gray after your custom selection, so you're unable to enjoy this Pro feature. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. My subscription also does not sync and work across various gadgets (Android phone, iPad) despite the same login details. Hope the overall tab would ALSO have the settings option to start during the day of signup. Seeing too many empty circles when building habits isn't motivating",2

abad7a93-677b-4fec-a36f-cbc7109684ad,I just downloaded the app. I had a very good feeling about it until I saw that I can't choose another color! That was so annoying. It's a very basic thing! At least make 3 colors free for the free version of the app. I hope that you solve this problem :folded_hands:,2

c6b709b0-450c-41cf-bd9e-78c7329c6e18,"The current bottom nav bar is really inconvenient. After we carefully set up our habits, why would we need to go to the pre-made habit ""Explore"" section? If we already saw everything here, a button in the ""Menu"" would be perfectly enough for it. But now, the main app navigation (bottom bar) is wasted for this. 3 buttons, ""Today , Weekly , Overall"" would fit here instead, then we could also swipe left/right between our Routines, giving much more practical functionally, better workflow.",2
933ed76b-e37e-469a-a162-7a374c90ebaf,"Don't update if you prefer the tasks to be centered in their bubbles. The update Left aligns everything; I don't like that. Also, the update locks the colors that were once available, now you have to pay for the app if you want the no longer free features.",2
e2d86030-3152-4fd7-b780-78c7dbf25284,"Using thefor in the last 4 months. Also bought the premium lifetime. Apart from supporting the developers, the premium isn't worth it. The analysis dosent give you much details other than streak and some percentages, and I havent found a way to export data to excel. TheFor sets your day and you can see it as a to-list. Now looking at the need for habits, thefor is perfect app. But if its a goal contains example - 10 cups of water a day, it's not comfortable. And the app lacks some widgets.8/10",2

5460a26c-43ea-4bd3-bb5b-d20814b29148,"What a shame, the goals wouldn't complete the frequency 1 at a time. For example, if your goal is to drink 10 glasses of water a day and you complete it, no matter if you adjust the quantity or not, it'll still be completed 10/10 instead of 1/10. I really loved this app and even used it's pro version but after knowing about this con, I now find it inconvenient and had to cancel the subscription and uninstall. I hope this app will fix this next time to improve it further. Looking forward to that.",2

It doesn't help me if I can only see those habits by clicking on the three dots,because they're still there as ""skipped"" and I didn't want them there.",2

56aeb8e2-f7b6-40a0-860c-871fe2b8c09d,"Was liking it at first. Simple, clean, fast UI. Paid for premium. Then realized after a while the numbers are almost always off. Streaks and best streak are now showing as 0 for most habits I've been tracking for 2+ months. And totals are completely off. Reported the issue with streaks the 1st time I noticed it and thought it was glitch and said theyd address it but that was 2 months ago.",2

I've struggled to find a habit tracker app that was easy and simple to use and I loved this one because there wasn't a lot going on because that makes it harder for me to actually follow the habits. (Readings,community stuff yk) Apparently you guys updated it and so now I'm not sure if I like the app anymore. I am never going to use the update and it really ruined this being a great app in my opinion.",2
