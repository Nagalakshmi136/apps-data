1b07fa5a-4f2d-417a-81ab-593c3cd1295c,Premium version is just waste of money nothing special I think you should remove all unnecessary things form this app like routine etc. And analytics is also complete garbage.,1
1d749a1c-4b89-4f65-b5d7-1199f6367424,Going from 5 stars to 1 star. I must have accidentally hit update. I didnt want the last update either. Loved the simplicity of the original version it worked bc it was simple yet intuitive. Now like the other apps with so much fluff and unnecessary options. Um analytics why.. u think I'm making a spreadsheet and handing it in to boss. AI for a to do list why??? I would have paid for the simple version. It's a strong no for the new one :(,1
d1727f81-2bb0-45fc-a51f-cb209639d259,"I tried the Routine AI but since I don't have premium they locked the results. Also, I downloaded this app for the journal thing but it also is available only for pro users.",1
4d8ae6aa-62c0-44c9-a449-4ed9510be819,"New Update Killed the score of using Pro for sometime. I had rewards that I intended on using later. It is just scam to remove a feature completely and not update it. Rating it one star. Older Review: Love the app. Wish atleast some of the analytics was available for free. Also please make it similar to iOS habit one so we can do ""50%"" or ""20%"" habit tracking.",1

Truly an apex in the late stage capitalism brain rot society :pensive_face: do not recommend, plenty of free apps offer all those features and done better 1/10",1

525314bf-a556-49f2-9e56-15600212c619,"No option to add 10,000 steps. 5,000 is maximum you can do. Also can't enter the number manually, imagine scrolling the wheel from 1 to get to 5000. Edit: response to developer - no, you can't! you can enter 4 numbers maximum, meaning, 9999 is the max, its impossible to do 10,000. Also, that doesnt work as goal, if the goal cant be set as 10,000 and 5000 is the max. Its a must for steps.",1

6ca62ecd-645c-4136-994d-f6328e126998,"Bad interactions design. Nothing happens when you try to save you habit and when you hit back, you see a million duplicate habits because you clicked countlessly waiting for something to happen after setting up your list.",1
