ea7acedb-9aef-4017-acd2-b67910098486,"I like the app, I like it's features and how it looks. I don't really like the 'Explore' tab and for something I don't think I really want, it does take up one third of the bottom menu options, I would replace it with a journal feed instead which would make it a 5 star app.",4
1d82a9b3-c8c5-420b-a5be-55215f4cea83,"Like this app. Is it possible to skip remind notifications for habit that is marked as done? I have once a week habit, but if it's done already at Monday, it annoying to remind through the rest of the week.",4
a233ed65-3db9-42ae-bfc0-ee9eb3d82b0a,"Love this app. Especially love that I can create routines. Just what I needed. My only complaint is, if I am in one of my routines, I would like it to stay on that screen until I change it, and not default to ""All"". I have an AM, afternoon and PM checklist. But unless I keep my phone on and the app open to that list, it defaults back to all, and I have to manually open the routine again. At least let me choose what it defaults to. Otherwise, the app is awesome.",4

I see you have a lot of options for types of tracking like minutes, ml, counts, pages etc, with the time options I have to manually put in the time, it would be really great if there was actually a timer, I feel like that could really streamline the experience, maybe kind of like how the Disciplined app did it.",4
ca87fe39-3006-4d9e-84a6-e472e4adbc83,"Permanent buy option. I just recently downloaded this app and the free options are good, I specially like that there is a permanent premium buy option.

Probably hundreds?) of different habit tracking apps trying to find the perfect balance of key features, beautiful interface, and SIMPLICITY. And this is it!! I love that I was able to buy lifetime access for just $20. It's such a good app! I Don't love the articles feature, but I just don't use that. If I could change one thing - I do wish I could set multiple reminders throughout the day for a habits (like drinking water for example) - but will VERY worth it",4
fc0116e2-cc98-4be6-9015-e86d28782e4c,"Love this habit tracker!!! I've played around with various apps, made custom trackers on Notion or directly on Google Calendar, but they've not been quite right. This one ticks all the boxes! My only wish is for them to make a watch app :crossed_fingers_medium-light_skin_tone::crossed_fingers_medium-light_skin_tone::crossed_fingers_medium-light_skin_tone: The routine feature isn't hitting the mark for me though - it's not that find-able within the app and I don't understand how it's meant to be used.. so I'm continuing with Routinery. But for habit tracking it's been fab!!!",4
92c84440-94d5-47bc-96b6-db24b2e271c0,I think this is a good app. to maintain habits. and make them good and to continue them when needed.,4
305a9044-87ad-41a0-80d4-2c2c0eac56da,I've been using Thefor for some time now. I've noticed that it's quite easy to accidentally mark a habit as completed without intending to on the weekly and history (months). This can disrupt the tracking accuracy and diminish the app's effectiveness. I suggest to add a sound or a short vibration when a habit is marked as completed to ensure the user is aware and avoid unintentional completion. Overall Great app.,4

cd5fd08d-6cef-4d87-aedb-6ca9ff7d0878,"It is a good application, the design is nice, but I think they could improve the visual and useful part of the widget, in addition to the option to repeat an event at different times of the day.",4
1b97e737-88c9-4289-9fae-7e92d6cd201e,"Very clean and crisp, would be good to have routines from specific goals (like an action path) so you can draw them into your daily habits. I would like to have a simple to-do list incorporated too.",4
e10850fc-96b3-4237-8102-6f776ead671f,"i love it, its simple, and there's no limits in how many habits you can put. I'd love some addition to the app though, like show in the widget or in the weekly, and overall logs if the habit was skipped. A symbol 'X' symbol would be nice or a '/' inside the circles. Anyway, i like that theres a lifetime option for the pro too, might consider buying — honestly i dont have experience on how subscriptions should be priced, they always seem overpriced for me, but 55 monthly dont seem too bad",4

40c5033c-8ba4-4eb5-94e5-dee1bfb7692a,"It's great app, giving five stars, but it bugs me that if I check that the certain habit is done (during the day, like 5pm) but the reminder is set to 10pm, it will still send the reminder even if it was completed before that.

Where is the start point? 2. Not really a problem, but I wish there was a way to get a deleted habit back, I know there's archive mod but not everyone's smart enough to see that. (as I'm not :grinning_face_with_sweat:) So I would really appriciate it if there was a way to get back habits you deleted after realizing it was a mistake, haha.",4

1b0f6b69-b919-451c-8184-9e95a4715996,"As a new user, I am currently utilizing this app. It's an app that is easy to use and is ideal for those who want to establish a new habit. The reason why this habit tracker app is superior to others is because it doesn't have any ads or unnecessary premiums. This app fully understands what the user wants, and they actually work on it. I am requesting an update to the app to add more colors as it only has a limited number of colors.",4

363c1287-cc6f-4af3-a010-283ca52ffcfc,"Great app for keep track of routines and habits. It's helped me a lot. Really smooth to use too. Only wish is that you could schedule habits for once every X days, as opposed to just on the weekly schedule.",4

18bacdd4-f958-4496-9cda-6fe91ebe5cf7,Good enough for my use case. I just need to track my daily and weekly habits. I like the simplicity of it. One issue I noticed is that the reminder still runs even if you have already completed the task prior to the time set.,4
723f3128-6eaf-4e64-b6a7-f80acf1709df,"It's a good app, one of the greatest that I've used. The only problem is the widget, they really used be more interactive. For example, you can complete your habits just by clicking on it via widget and especially see the days when the habits needs to get done. Another, is that there should also be a way where we can use the widget like having it organized by day and what needs to get done by when. It's also said there's more widgets, but there's only one accessible? (for me)",4
