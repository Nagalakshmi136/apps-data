Despite numerous attempts to get a refund for a service I didn't use, they were unhelpful and dismissive. Their responses were slow, and they showed no willingness to resolve my issue.

The automatic payment structure is absolutely opaque. The way to cancel subscription is so confusing that I ended up being paying 80 euros because I assumed I had canceled their useless service when in reality you have to jump through many hoops until your subscription is canceled. The continue with cancellation button is hidden at the very end! This is a disgrace,1

I immediately noticed that this app and website was employing these learned techniques to maximize their chances of extracting money from me. From the start, I had problems getting signed up and synchronizing the Android App and my trial account. I ran headlong into a tracking cookie that was blocked by my ad blocker (which I could have overridden, but it's there for a reason and that reason is to notify me when I'm dealing with designers engaged in suspect behavior). So ultimately, I reached the point of maximum frustration (I had breached my 'sunken costs' limit) at which point I cancelled my subscription payment authorization, then eventually found my account and cancelled the subscription itself - all without even getting the chance to evaluate the habit-forming methods it purported to provide me. Net result: it cost me $1 to determine that I wasn't the kind of sucker they were after and also that I was willing to spend all this time writing this review (which I've quite enjoyed) and give them one star to help reduce their extremely overrated rating. I'm not saying anything about their methodology (because I never got there), but rather that they're making certain assumptions about the audience they're after, and I'm not it. Carry on.",1

Fabulous have been trying to still invoice me for an annual payment since June. I have emailed them four times about this and have not received one reply in 6 weeks. Yesterday they took a payment from my bank account for a years subscription. This has to be one of the worst levels of customer service I have experienced. It is one thing for a company to have a system glitch that takes a payment by mistake but this feels like they are willfully ignoring all customer enquires in order to continue fleecing people. I note that their social media pages are updated regularly so clearly they do have some staff working for them. Helping to sort out customer issues is obviously not a priority for them.

I listen to the morning, Focus, and night coaching. I have been using the app for a year - thru COVID - and I believe it helped me through a difficult, challenging time. Here are the challenges: * you can not interact with Fabulous on a laptop. I would love to read some of the coaching on my big screen. * Fabulous does NOT communicate. When the app was upgraded, I found out because coaching disappeared - out of the blue. No message to re-install. I uninstalled and re-installed app. Even though I was premium and had ""backed up my journey,"" no journey appeared - and I had to restart at the beginning. That was not an issue. It was like hitting refresh. * I just found out I needed to renew. The announcement came as a banner in the middle of the day. No warning in advance that I would need to renew. Even though I was logged in with the email address that I associate with Fabulous email, it defaulted to my work email - an account I accidentally started - and now can not remove. *With renewal, you have to go thru an awkward sign-in. Fabulous does not recognize you as a ""premium"" member until you have answered several question, enter a user name - and then finally enter your email. Why not start with the email? * I did renew. I am now waiting for my journey to be restored - which can take up to ten minutes. Really? 10 minutes - and the restoration only had my morning and evening routine. My afternoon routine was missing - AND my progress for the last month is not present. I also tried to ""redownload everything - and I got nothing more. Sooooooo frustrating. Again, I love the app - the coaching especially. The administrative end - communicating about program upgrades and renewal, ""restoring your journey,"" renewing, accessing your account - pretty bad. 5 stars on content; 1 for admin. One day later - Fabulous will nor give me access to my premium account.",1

However the developer never replied, and instead redirected me through a series of automated replies back to google support. The second time I contacted google support, they had confirmed to me that app developers can simply steal your money and hide behind policy becoming untraceable.

I've now paid for a year's subscription for a product I have no intention of using. Your seven-day trial period is not long enough. If you are ""Fabulous"" you should offer a longer trial period or a refund up to two weeks of using the app. That's how normal businesses treat their customers; if the product or service doesn't work for a client, they get their money back. Your no-refund policy makes me wonder how solvent your company is and how much you believe in what you are promoting. If the product is good for most, you'll do fine by treating the ones it doesn't work for fairly, because you'll have many, many pleased customers, happy to pay the annual fee. Are things that precarious for Fabulous?*** I signed up for this app after the 7-day free trial, but seven days is not long enough to really understand what this app does.

a6a9a65a-0d14-41ee-b004-267a79b8f29a,"First, I did pay for premium. I wanted to use this app. At first I liked it, regarding how it functions and aids habit forming, but I was slowly driven nuts by the jarring alarm tone. The alarm sounds like one a crank-handle music box device. But with a microphone on it making it loud and clangy. I looked all over the app, and I could not find the choice to change the alarm tone. I've been a computer user since 1983, so I'm pretty good at figuring things out on my own. But no option was found, so I ended up turning the alarm off, which basically makes the app useless, as being reminded to do your habit activities is what the app is about. Then I inquired with customer service, asking if it can be changed, and the answer I received was false. I was told where to look for changing the alarm tone, and where I was told to look, the choice was not there. I'm honestly stunned. The alarm tone is awful, and why is it not obvious that you can change it to something you find more enjoyable (assuming you can and she just told me the incorrect answer)? But maybe there is no way to change it? I wrote them back and I'll update with the answer. You know, I gotta remember, if you see too many ads for something, that means either it's not good or its really expensive. I've already researched comparable apps and will be testing those out. There only so much time I'm going to waste on this app.",1

Recently they unilaterally changed the sound cues of the app resulting in a very confused and frustrating morning. I didn't ask for that and I can't change it back.

The creators and operators of this app have absolutely no intention of aiding and assisting customers develop and maintain healthy habits, they are purely in it for the money. Their deceit is proof of that.

Pretty shocking actually, clearly more about money than to help people.",1

I contacted the developer and they refuse to respond. On top of this, the app doesn't even work well. Notifications appear multiple times a day for the same thing, and even when you say ""yes, i did this"" three seperate times, it sometimes STILL doesn't mark it as done, and you lose your streak.

A really great combination of words which will fit you and your app the most due to the marketing of it and design of the app itself. And here's why: I've found this app via add. It just annoyed me everywhere (facebook, instagram, etc). Ok. I decided to give it a chance. Started 7-day trial. And here is the first tricky thing - you should use your credit card to start it this one. Here comes the important detail. You have been warned that you can CENCEL subscription. Looks good and legit. I've tried it for 5 days (I will skip the part of buggy and laggy UI-UX design). And I've deleted this app BEFORE the trial ended. A couple of days after, I received SMS that I was charged money for the subscription for 1 year. I tested and deleted a lot of premium apps and NONE of them did such a trick. Can you see the thing? How many people do the same action: Download the app, tested it, deleted and NOT BEING CHARGED! And how many people could get into situation like this. This app charge you even if you'll forget to cancel the subscription without any warning. I just paid for nothing. You won't be able to get your money back, because there is one line regarding it - YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. But if won't do this I will lose my money even if I'll delete the app. SO here one more trick! I had to download this thing, reenabled my JOURNEY(omg I'm sick of it) AND CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION. Thus, If you won't do it you'll be charged for another year of subscription, and so on and so on and so on. Nice move. Nice game of words. Guys you're just muggers!",1

Now my friends is asking me for payment of that your Apps deduct amount. i request you to kindly help me refund this amount as it is not fair to deduct amount from credit card without any authorization.... i email you yesterday and i was instructed to contact Google Play-store...please there is no any process to contact google -play-store....kindly help to refund this as soon as possible. otherwise i have to take a legal course for this sum.......",1

Same for any of the note-based habits. Gratitude journal included. Fix that, and it is a five star app with a great team behind it. Edit: Dropping to one star. Support suggested that the the notes getting wiped out, and the counters starting over was a bug; fine, happens. Followed the directions given to basically start all over, then things got worse. Ritual alarms suddenly went nuts, even the silent notification-bar icons were popping at the wrong times. I even got interrupted by Fabulous notifications when meditating, a few times!

Starting all over again sucks and the letters are annoying. This app needs flexibility. Edit: now that ""sphere,"" a paid subscription, has been implemented, the app has become less flexible and many options are locked without paying. This app has become total trash and I regret trying it again.",1

It really became a jewel of an app. Ask any 'first users' and they will say the same. *SPHERE was what really broke everyone's heart* No feature we loved was the same. No ""fabulous is ALWAYS free""-their DIRECT QUOTE (saved) saying they would never charge. *SPHERE made what was Free & available to all, 9.99 per month.* They removed the beautiful, real voice it used-replaced it with a robotic woman. Beautiful letters&pictures were now boring, short, heartless alternatives. We all were told we would b ok since we were the loyal members since day 1. However, like many apps, there was a reg update and when downloaded, SPHERE was hidden inside locking all old journeys and achievements. No going back. I feel like they ripped my favorite app of all time from me in a sneaky, unfair way. *It broke my, and many others hearts, as this app was *TRULY* the best and used to be absolutely fabulous* Thank you.:blue_heart:xo Ana:blue_heart:",1

For Huawei P8 Lite users: You must set Fabulous as a protected app and allow it to ring in Silent mode if you turn your Media volume down (the alarm/notification uses the Media volume!) and I also have to use the Full Screen alarm option. 5 stars for customer service and functionality! Now let's see if this app helps me keep my morning routine under an hour :) ---- ORIGINAL REVIEW (1 star): REALLY wanted to like this app as it came highly recommended.
