A little text bubble would pop up saying that the app wasn't optimized for my phone blah blah and I'd have to restart my phone to get it to work again. I subscribed to premium because I was talked into it but I could never really use it because of how glitchy it is. It was a waste of time tbh.,2

98f5e2e4-b003-4995-ac9d-0a82329d26bb,"I preface this review for those of you who already are good with goals and are looking for an app for to-do lists and reminders that are slick and swanky and something fun. I have in the past used ""Habitica,"" which is gamification of to-do lists, but basically, I already was a high wizard with all the pets and things, so I wanted to use something new. If you are like that, here is my take. Please note that this is me, and my opinion is subjective. I wanted something I could use that would help me keep track of tasks. My friend, who isn't, said this app had the best to-do lists and reminders and was fun. So, I thought, what the heck, let's try! You get reminders, and they are colorful, animated, and poetic. You also get mantras, and chapters, and so much fluff. I'm not sure I needed the fluff or wanted that part, but hey, it's there. I mastered the first few things in a matter of days because I'm good at that. I do that already. Most of the app is for personal care, self-care, and health. Little of it is for ambitious things, or housework subroutines, etc. Additionally, you cannot build weekly sub-routines nor build monthly or quarterly routines. But a small thing such as putting in a reminder every month to six weeks that include changing your air filters, checking your water filters, and replacing the baking soda in the fridge, well that is impossible. The coaching was not something I needed or looked at, nor was any motivation stuff; I only came for lists. I also had no interaction with extras. What finally got me to uninstall and prompted this review was this scenario I had two days in a row where life had an emergency that overlapped the daily routine I usually did. Later in the day, both days, the routine was done, just not logged when it usually was set for. So the third day, I logged in, and I got 10 minutes lecture routine I could not get rid of. It told me that I was failing my goals and addressing ""The elephant in the room."" When I tried to get out of this subroutine, it'd show back up repeatedly overlapping my lists. This routine even had a different voice; this was a man telling me I was in the wrong, not the normal friendly lady voice it'd been using. I'm not 6, and I don't need a man voice I've never interacted with, only showing up to tell me I'm failing. I know when I'm being ""mom-splained"" or ""man-splained,"" and I don't like it any more than anyone does. Especially when I wasn't failing, I just didn't hit buttons in the order of the time they wanted me to. I canceled it, and I'm not going to go back.",2

Then you should ask if I want to continue my subscription after the 30 days. Just an idea.. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",2

When I finish the first task of the drinking water stuff they was talking about breakfast part and this is the way they was putting down people mention people to eat a breakfast and went on that donuts or other items is not breakfast part. I'm like excuse me now some people don't have the time to sit down and cook a breakfast now that this app wanted to do or even know how to cook a breakfast at all. Some people just have the time to grab a donut or other breakfast items. The app should said something to eat a breakfast consider it is a important to eat a breakfast not to put them down if they don't have the time to do a breakfast. I always eat a breakfast not matter what. I feel like this app tells you not to do that many task then after you finish one they force you to do another one right way. I'm was like I wanted to pace myself at least give one week to do one task to get a route or pattern down then put another one on the people. I cancel my free trial before it fully ends.

Another issue is that the app takes no consideration into what level you are at when you start. I train at a high level and to have to complete arbitrary tasks like training for 10min each day doesn't work for me.

Since the introduction of 'Sphere' it got worse. I tried the paid membership (and was only able to because of a discount for long-term users) but it wasn't worth it for me. Then I saw more and more features removed from the free version. In the end, I only stuck around this long because of the 'rituals' - specified routines for set times of the day - I have yet to find something like it elsewhere.

A better approach would be to let people download a demo and then pay for the full version deliberately, if they find it useful. This kind of basic social engineering should be less complicated than what the app attempts to accomplish, and is either due to incompetence or is an intentionally manipulative way to get people to give them money. So that's strike one for me. Strike two: the app takes a sickly sweet over the top motivational speaker approach. Even the voice of the actor who reads the information in the first ""lesson"" is like a cheery neighbor who thinks ""chin up, life is amazing!"" Is the panacea to end all ills, and that anyone who thinks otherwise must be creating their own problems. Strike three: the developers seem to have a one-size fits all attitude toward self improvement.

I repeatedly deactivated them in both general and sphere settings. They stay turned off in sphere settings, but immediately reactivate as soon as I navigate away from the settings screen. These have a type of flickering animation that triggers migraine for me. The volume control is bad, esp around meditation - bells are incredibly loud, but the guided voice is almost inaudible.

The app will often provide messages that seem like they're those helpful bits of information, but are clever disguises for the paid option. Quite frustrating. * The letters after completing an achievement are gigantic and incidentally a pain to read. * Too much emphasis on sharing the app with friends.

Here is the issue: it is such a cluttered and disorganized app. It is frustrating trying to maneuver the home screen. There are countless articles and tabs spread everywhere as messy as my room. Yes the Motivator articles are nice, but there is no reason for five to be cluttering the front page when all I want is simplicity. Additionally, it would be great if you could tell the app to stop badgering you every morning about exercising, as I can only lift weights three times a week. I should be able to tell it days I plan on lifting. And stop shoving the useless ten minute exercises in my face that will not do the job.

I wanted a solid little motivational tool to assist me in building the healthy habits I want in my life, and instead this app is entirely prescriptive with things that are not science based. There's nothing that suggests that drinking water first thing in the morning (your first ""healthy habit"") is that important so long as you aren't chronically dehydrated, and likewise the research on breakfast and weight loss is largely correlational and sketchy. The more solid research on this suggests that yes, for some it's helpful, but for some subgroup (30-40%) being forced to eat breakfast actually causes weight GAIN. Leading to my second big complaint, total lack of choice. Research supports informed choices as the single best motivator in changing healthy behaviors for the better, but you get no choice at all in which habits you work on, it's entirely prescriptive. And lastly, if you DO want choice, you have to pay. As the app reminds you constantly. I'm normally not bothered by such things, but this app is basically one large advertisement for the premium service, which is quite expensive. To sum: not science based, no choice, and it's really just another expensive wellness gimmick pretending to be a free motivational app. Don't waste your time, you're better off setting daily reminders on your phone.",2

That's not really ok. Yes, there's probably nothing wrong with what they ask you to do; yes, it probably will be a mix of good habits and pointless habits. But it should raise red flags for everyone - this is also Cult Recruitment 101, where they build up obedience through conditioning and small positive changes until you find you've donated all your worldly possessions simply because it's the next step on your transformative journey.

ea54a49b-d8b5-4db4-8935-e0836e594f87,"If you have specific lifestyle needs this is a really unhelpful app. Frankly its a messy app, at least the free version, only offering a one size fits all approach to habit changing. There is so little interaction with the user there is something useless for everyone. The only exception comes from being able to skip some proposed changes, and if you skip enough it asks you to complete a feedback questionnaire, which gives the only opportunity to say what needs to be different for you. However, submitting the feedback just hangs there, wasting more of my time. A lot of the advice is fine, but even there they clutter the app with tasks that are either not needed or distract from a core point, like 3 days of drink from a favourite glass or bottle. I get why but on the back several other 3 day tasks about drinking water, or tea instead of coffee et al. Some habit changing tasks waste time if you don't need to change anything, drinking water when you wake being a prime example. Some things are bad suggestions for large identifiable groups, but there is no system for checking this. For example, I'm diabetic diet controlled, so drink fruit smoothies is an unhealthy suggestion for me. Actually drinking anything but a 90% low sugar veg smoothie is bad for everyone. The app tells you to buy eggs, my vegan partner would uninstall right there. I'm probably not the target audience, as I have a lifestyle built around chronic illness management, the medication being part of a cycle of side effects, disrupting sleep, focus, strength, pain, mental health et al, but even the average person could feel alienated by the lack of customisation. Without, for example, a questionnaire when you start the app about what good habits you already have and which bad habits you want to change, the app borders on useless if you don't fit into the rigid assumptions the app makes about you. Given that all this smacks of lack of interest in the individual, it's laughable that they start herding you towards buying a plan on the first day before they've even begun to prove the app is worthwhile, especially at nearly £10, too much money before you've even tried. Naturally this gave me the sense of profit over people and gave me no confidence the 'plan' would be better than one I put together myself.",2

I checked off a completed habit when I thought I was just setting up the habit. On one habit task, I hit ""Skip"" and the next screen said something like, ""Good job."" Uninstalling.",2

I'd rather not be annoyed 3 times a day (had 3 routines set up, each one had reminder inserted). They justify the expense with 'you care more about what you pay for' (which is a true-but-over-simplified point that does not explain >$150/year) An extended 'inspirational' quote from Ayn Rand does not sell me on the product. Either they don't care about the larger context of the quote OR they do support the messages in Atlas Shrugged---either way, not where I want to draw inspiration from. The 'tips' attached to routine items are a mixture of good/helpful and suspect, and there's no way to edit them. For all their emphasis on science-based help, some of the tips contradict health research and offer unsupported, pop-culture 'advice'. -=- Previous version: Extremely useful for setting up routines that simplify life and save energy for the actual work.

I didn't have time to do the morning rituals. For example it put time 15 min to eat breakfast 8 min to exercise in morning ritual. It took me 30 min to eat breakfast and i wanted to exercise in the evening. No such option. When I scheduled it manually I did not get the articles related to that ritual. So it became useless for me.,2

I had done the habits that day, but because I didn't check the boxes on that exact day, back to day 1 and more of the endless stretch.
