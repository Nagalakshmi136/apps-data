It insists way too much for you to pay for a subscription plan even before you get a glimpse of what the app is about. I uninstalled it and still got billed later for a subscription I didn't ask for but probably accepted at some point unaware of it.

Part of it (a big one) is promoting their other apps and is easier to get a miracle then a refund (customer service is slow, unresponsive, and contact channels are extremely limited, you send a message to a generic email address and pray for an answer).

A little text bubble would pop up saying that the app wasn't optimized for my phone blah blah and I'd have to restart my phone to get it to work again. I subscribed to premium because I was talked into it but I could never really use it because of how glitchy it is. It was a waste of time tbh.,2

However, I stopped using it after some months because the UX feels overly complicated and crammed with too many things.

The one simple little thing that I want from this app is a widget for my routines and habits and they don't even have that. It would make it so much easier to use it daily.",2

First, you should probably ask if there are certain tasks that person cannot do before setting up the routine.

98f5e2e4-b003-4995-ac9d-0a82329d26bb,"I preface this review for those of you who already are good with goals and are looking for an app for to-do lists and reminders that are slick and swanky and something fun. I have in the past used ""Habitica,"" which is gamification of to-do lists, but basically, I already was a high wizard with all the pets and things, so I wanted to use something new. If you are like that, here is my take. Please note that this is me, and my opinion is subjective. I wanted something I could use that would help me keep track of tasks. My friend, who isn't, said this app had the best to-do lists and reminders and was fun. So, I thought, what the heck, let's try! You get reminders, and they are colorful, animated, and poetic. You also get mantras, and chapters, and so much fluff. I'm not sure I needed the fluff or wanted that part, but hey, it's there. I mastered the first few things in a matter of days because I'm good at that. I do that already. Most of the app is for personal care, self-care, and health. Little of it is for ambitious things, or housework subroutines, etc. Additionally, you cannot build weekly sub-routines nor build monthly or quarterly routines. But a small thing such as putting in a reminder every month to six weeks that include changing your air filters, checking your water filters, and replacing the baking soda in the fridge, well that is impossible. The coaching was not something I needed or looked at, nor was any motivation stuff; I only came for lists. I also had no interaction with extras. What finally got me to uninstall and prompted this review was this scenario I had two days in a row where life had an emergency that overlapped the daily routine I usually did. Later in the day, both days, the routine was done, just not logged when it usually was set for. So the third day, I logged in, and I got 10 minutes lecture routine I could not get rid of. It told me that I was failing my goals and addressing ""The elephant in the room."" When I tried to get out of this subroutine, it'd show back up repeatedly overlapping my lists. This routine even had a different voice; this was a man telling me I was in the wrong, not the normal friendly lady voice it'd been using. I'm not 6, and I don't need a man voice I've never interacted with, only showing up to tell me I'm failing. I know when I'm being ""mom-splained"" or ""man-splained,"" and I don't like it any more than anyone does. Especially when I wasn't failing, I just didn't hit buttons in the order of the time they wanted me to. I canceled it, and I'm not going to go back.",2

I'm like excuse me now some people don't have the time to sit down and cook a breakfast now that this app wanted to do or even know how to cook a breakfast at all. Some people just have the time to grab a donut or other breakfast items. The app should said something to eat a breakfast consider it is a important to eat a breakfast not to put them down if they don't have the time to do a breakfast. I always eat a breakfast not matter what. I feel like this app tells you not to do that many task then after you finish one they force you to do another one right way. I'm was like I wanted to pace myself at least give one week to do one task to get a route or pattern down then put another one on the people. I cancel my free trial before it fully ends.

Another issue is that the app takes no consideration into what level you are at when you start. I train at a high level and to have to complete arbitrary tasks like training for 10min each day doesn't work for me.

Fabulous targets people who have a fair bit of disposable income and no major health issues, mental or otherwise. If you don't fit in these groups, you will notice it was not made for you. Still, my review used to be 5 stars. Even with clinical depression and not enough money to feed myself properly, I found useful advice in the app, even if I had to seriously adjust the high expectations and demands it sets for its users. Since the introduction of 'Sphere' it got worse. I tried the paid membership (and was only able to because of a discount for long-term users) but it wasn't worth it for me. Then I saw more and more features removed from the free version. In the end, I only stuck around this long because of the 'rituals' - specified routines for set times of the day - I have yet to find something like it elsewhere. The last straw was seeing Fabulous use the very same tactics it uses to encourage positive change to try to sell you the subscription. It's really not very subtle and does a great job of turning people away.",2

A better approach would be to let people download a demo and then pay for the full version deliberately, if they find it useful. This kind of basic social engineering should be less complicated than what the app attempts to accomplish, and is either due to incompetence or is an intentionally manipulative way to get people to give them money. So that's strike one for me. Strike two: the app takes a sickly sweet over the top motivational speaker approach. Even the voice of the actor who reads the information in the first ""lesson"" is like a cheery neighbor who thinks ""chin up, life is amazing!"" Is the panacea to end all ills, and that anyone who thinks otherwise must be creating their own problems. Strike three: the developers seem to have a one-size fits all attitude toward self improvement.

And if you click on that said notification, it won't get dismissed, it will just turn on all the alarms instead!! It's really annoying with all the alarms!!!",2

I work night shift and then also have stuff to get done during the day on my off days so it wasn't helpful in building habits because I couldnt stay on a steady sleep schedule due to work and when companies office hours are. I don't think this is fully the apps fault but they didn't account for that which causes you to not be able to adjust it to each day your schedule changes. Which may help. I also found that after two months I got so used to hearing the same sounds the app gives off that I found myself dismissing it subconsciously like nurses do when they hear call bell alarms so much there brain eventually blocks the alarms out. I think this app is definitely a step in the right direction and I am going to try it again when I am able to quit my night shift job because I do believe it would help someone if they are on a steady schedule already and if the app changed the sounds every few months or rotated sounds so your brain doesn't have time to get used to them.",2

28609664-38bb-4713-9f94-1751a5accb4a,"Very condescending app. The free trial program aims for you to form the habit of drinking water first thing, eating breakfast and exercising before you do anything else. If you aren't interested in doing these you can't opt out, it just tells you to try harder and if you don't use it it will send you notification telling you to remember what inspired you to start the 'fabulous journey' as though it was something virtuous and not doing these three things means you are failing. Great idea but I could do without the condescension. I am not a morning person and have to get up before the sun to go to work already, waking up to my phone telling me I need to do just one minute of exercise to be a successful person is not a good start to the day. I don't think it is virtuous or helpful to do exercise in the morning and I already have an exercise routine in the afternoon that works for me. It would be much better if you could enter preference as to when you want to do activities. Definitely do not buy until you have tried it.

Here is the issue: it is such a cluttered and disorganized app. It is frustrating trying to maneuver the home screen. There are countless articles and tabs spread everywhere as messy as my room. Yes the Motivator articles are nice, but there is no reason for five to be cluttering the front page when all I want is simplicity. Additionally, it would be great if you could tell the app to stop badgering you every morning about exercising, as I can only lift weights three times a week. I should be able to tell it days I plan on lifting. And stop shoving the useless ten minute exercises in my face that will not do the job.

I wanted a solid little motivational tool to assist me in building the healthy habits I want in my life, and instead this app is entirely prescriptive with things that are not science based. There's nothing that suggests that drinking water first thing in the morning (your first ""healthy habit"") is that important so long as you aren't chronically dehydrated, and likewise the research on breakfast and weight loss is largely correlational and sketchy. The more solid research on this suggests that yes, for some it's helpful, but for some subgroup (30-40%) being forced to eat breakfast actually causes weight GAIN. Leading to my second big complaint, total lack of choice. Research supports informed choices as the single best motivator in changing healthy behaviors for the better, but you get no choice at all in which habits you work on, it's entirely prescriptive. And lastly, if you DO want choice, you have to pay. As the app reminds you constantly. I'm normally not bothered by such things, but this app is basically one large advertisement for the premium service, which is quite expensive. To sum: not science based, no choice, and it's really just another expensive wellness gimmick pretending to be a free motivational app. Don't waste your time, you're better off setting daily reminders on your phone.",2

That's not really ok. Yes, there's probably nothing wrong with what they ask you to do; yes, it probably will be a mix of good habits and pointless habits. But it should raise red flags for everyone - this is also Cult Recruitment 101, where they build up obedience through conditioning and small positive changes until you find you've donated all your worldly possessions simply because it's the next step on your transformative journey.

However, I ended up deleting it because there seemed to be a lack of personalization. It started me off with drinking water in the morning for 3 days. Easy enough, but I love drinking my tea first thing and I drink a lot of water throughout the day so it just wasn't a suitable goal for me. One of the next things was exercising after waking up. I have a chronic illness and really wanted to love this app, but, again, I need to exercise later in the day because of my pain level when I wake up. I didn't see an option to modify the goal to be appropriate for me. My other issue was that it started slowly, which is realistic, but after a week, I opened my phone after waking up and I had all these notifications popping up- ""Did you drink water?"", ""Did you exercise?"", ""Go for a sprint"", etc. I don't even know where going for a sprint came from. It just asked me to start exercising, even if it's 5 minutes, but then it's telling me to sprint?? So confused. All you can do is check it off, snooze it, or skip it. I hated pressing "" skip"" all the time. Also, I do eat breakfast after waking up, as recommended, but by the time I eat, it's probably closer to an hour after waking up. So then I have to keep hitting ""Snooze"" or just ignore it. All in all, it just became confusing for me and I have my masters in psychology. It would be nicer to have a goal list that I could go in and see and check off when I do them. Also, it needs to become somewhat personalized without you feeling like you're just skipping over everything. I don't want to sprint for exercise, now or ever. I'm also not going to go to my grocery store just to pick up a few things that I don't actually need (which was another thing I was supposed to do).

ea54a49b-d8b5-4db4-8935-e0836e594f87,"If you have specific lifestyle needs this is a really unhelpful app. Frankly its a messy app, at least the free version, only offering a one size fits all approach to habit changing. There is so little interaction with the user there is something useless for everyone. The only exception comes from being able to skip some proposed changes, and if you skip enough it asks you to complete a feedback questionnaire, which gives the only opportunity to say what needs to be different for you. However, submitting the feedback just hangs there, wasting more of my time. A lot of the advice is fine, but even there they clutter the app with tasks that are either not needed or distract from a core point, like 3 days of drink from a favourite glass or bottle. I get why but on the back several other 3 day tasks about drinking water, or tea instead of coffee et al. Some habit changing tasks waste time if you don't need to change anything, drinking water when you wake being a prime example. Some things are bad suggestions for large identifiable groups, but there is no system for checking this. For example, I'm diabetic diet controlled, so drink fruit smoothies is an unhealthy suggestion for me. Actually drinking anything but a 90% low sugar veg smoothie is bad for everyone. The app tells you to buy eggs, my vegan partner would uninstall right there. I'm probably not the target audience, as I have a lifestyle built around chronic illness management, the medication being part of a cycle of side effects, disrupting sleep, focus, strength, pain, mental health et al, but even the average person could feel alienated by the lack of customisation. Without, for example, a questionnaire when you start the app about what good habits you already have and which bad habits you want to change, the app borders on useless if you don't fit into the rigid assumptions the app makes about you. Given that all this smacks of lack of interest in the individual, it's laughable that they start herding you towards buying a plan on the first day before they've even begun to prove the app is worthwhile, especially at nearly ¬£10, too much money before you've even tried.

I'd rather not be annoyed 3 times a day (had 3 routines set up, each one had reminder inserted). They justify the expense with 'you care more about what you pay for' (which is a true-but-over-simplified point that does not explain >$150/year) An extended 'inspirational' quote from Ayn Rand does not sell me on the product. Either they don't care about the larger context of the quote OR they do support the messages in Atlas Shrugged---either way, not where I want to draw inspiration from. The 'tips' attached to routine items are a mixture of good/helpful and suspect, and there's no way to edit them. For all their emphasis on science-based help, some of the tips contradict health research and offer unsupported, pop-culture 'advice'. -=- Previous version: Extremely useful for setting up routines that simplify life and save energy for the actual work.

Writing a todo list every morning didn't take long for me to get accustomed to, same with prioritizing it. I""ll probably keep these two habits for the rest of my life. The rest of the habits haven't been as simple or easy for me. 25 minute work sessions while writing down all interruptions? Sounds great, but I've noticed when they are done I tend to take LONG breaks. Not 5 minutes, but like an hour. Maybe something to help with this? Lock my phone for two hours? Holy heck it's getting real in here. Sounds like a great idea, but the first couple days I did it I felt really burned out, rather than energized. I went home and engaged in all my bad habits to try to feel nice again. Also, the rituals are difficult to time to a ""real life"".
