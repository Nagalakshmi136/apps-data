Update, left and came back, as it helps: it's a prop, nudge when I become indecisive and it helps me to resist falling back into negativity - quite a feat! I mainly use the daily routine scheduler features, but occasionally hop onto the community area, and quite often listen to the soothingly motivational messages.",4

415d1d2c-32dd-4ed0-9812-22e742b2b224,Enjoying it for the first week. The idea of building habits by tackling them little by little is very useful.,4
57d8794a-a142-4d43-b032-ae29ca93bee3,It's a good app. Love the colors and visual. When going into mood tracking I thought there would be more. I'm just using the app so I'll update again in about a week.,4

18d765e7-50d1-4104-a742-6c166c9881e9,The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because it's so much Beals and whistles that I haven't even gotten around to,4

dc86d0c8-0f79-4c90-830c-902815caa3c0,So far I love this app. I've always had a lot of trouble convincing myself to get things done. The only thing I don't like a whole lot is the screen is a little bit over crowded and 13.99 a month is a little steep for me as a college student. I sadly probably wont use this past the free trial due to this. If they had a student plan I probably would tho,4

122b77a8-7ab0-42f7-b50a-eef53e5074b4,"The reason why I rated just 4 stars because the trailer version is only for 7 days, which is not enough to know every single detail about this great app, one more thing I forgot to add which is locked features within the app itself.

da4cdb58-5ffb-411e-8c72-015907ea9611,"I'm glad that I went back to using Fabulous. Now they have many sister apps, and the ads atop my homepage are distracting clutter that I have to swipe to clear. This is despite being a premium member. Otherwise I like the updates since I started years ago.",4

a44e9be5-d917-437f-844a-0876eb97c8ee,it's been easier to build habits when receiving direction and validation along the way!,4
e1c06306-43c7-4012-9a61-559dbd07b85d,"I have a habit of downloading random wellness apps, hoping they'll magically change my life, but they usually disappoint. Most just let me list tasks or habits and send reminders, which only works for a few days before I lose motivation and uninstall them. However, this app is different. It offers real solutions to the challenges you face when building healthy habits. It also helps you connect with your emotions and references real studies and books, which I really appreciate.",4

7dd1f41d-8c02-4091-b72b-3c2495f17825,I love it. Just for the fact that it applies what I learnt in James Clear's book Atomic Habits. The only downside for me is that I'm unable to use MTN momo to pay. I wish that option could be made available. So for that reason 4 stars,4
aedd3ec1-3f95-46be-80a2-a8b338f8179e,A really great app only reason I haven't given it 5 is because I got a bit lax with using it as I had a child and left my job so it was difficult maintaining it. The alerts stopped coming through and I ended up uninstalling it. A few phones later and I wanted to give it another go as I have ADHD and thought it might help maintain focus at work. I'm sure it was free when I first used it and now it isn't :loudly_crying_face: now looking for a free alternative.,4

36ec79c3-35bf-48eb-a47b-55b66c7a845b,I liked its experience but the only thing is that you cannot make your own habits or plan according to your need without paying,4
a95bd670-ec0a-477e-b84b-e918a423e098,"I haven't used it just yet but it looks like a colorful and cheerful encouragement to stay on track. Why am I only able to set up the account with my Google email instead of any of the other email platforms?Also, before even putting in my email, it wants to know immediately how much sleep I get each night. This seems a bit intrusive and limiting. I'm not going to delete the app just yet, but I'm hoping to get a response.You see, I flipped a coin per usual, to decide email.Leopard or Spots change",4
ef2871f6-52e4-43fb-8343-67ca65c7477a,please get it but i am not sure about data sharing privacy policy. Good helpful app. :thumbs_up:great app again get it you can add events of your life and how you felt at the time,4

9b164f51-8f16-48cf-95a8-87a99013af1f,"So far, very positive. I do however think that the monthly payment asked is still to high. Should be about a third of this. Another example of ""what can we get away with charging, as opossed to what do we need to charge"". A very useful app though.",4

Periodically, the app shows little graphics with tips and offers you a button to save the image. But when I try to save it, it just sends a link to the Fabulous app without the image. I hope it's a mistake, but it feels crummy that I try to share or save a picture with self care tips, but end up just linking the app. Why would you offer to save the image if it doesn't actually work?",4

The added features are helpful to stay on point with task and goals. I also don't like the fact that the branch off/ sister apps you have to pay for as well. It's built into this one like it's included.,4

Having this app helps me with feeling in control over my day and I like the option of watching ads to get the premium for a day since I don't always use it and paying a monthly subscription or buying an app that I only use every once in a while is a bit unwise.

No guilt tripping and focus is on doing positive things rather than abstaining from negative ones which is a lovely change.

a2d6e686-7441-4b09-bc62-e6db27afa81d,The fabulous app definitely has potential to do great things but why do we have access to the daily coaching if you have to pay to actually get coaching. I put it on my daily routine list but have recently taken it off because if you don't have premium there almost no point for using the coaching option. as it starts to read you maybe get 1 minute through and it cuts off mid sentence would be nice if there was some form of free coaching.,4

Some posts may be harmful to your way of thinking but there is only a ""feedback on post"" and not a quietly block and move on. 2: sharing links to circles requires copy/pasting link. Lack of easy entry discourages joining and building unique groups",4

It guides you one small step at a time. Many of us fail in our habit forming because we overload ourselves. There is great science behind this app. As for pricing I see it as an investment. Paying for something gives it value and thus helps in its incentive to follow through. It's starts so easy but those small habits build. It's smart app, I'm still figuring it out",4

Alarms and reminders: they seem to be completely off the time I set for them. They appear whenever they want. They appear long after finished activity or 2-3 hours before alarm time. Please fix it! It's very frustrating! 2. Provide premium users with more off-line routines and programmes. I don't want to participate in live events, neither do I want to create additional account for such activity.",4

It is visually and acoustically pleasing. That being said, it can be a bit overwhelming and confusing at times. My ADHD brain just can't filter through all of the information. It will take some time to learn. Still a great app.",4

There are a few fixes that need to be made, like the option to zoom in on the infographics so you can read them, and I feel a little confused as to what I'm supposed to do next sometimes because a few things poop up at once.

c9255692-0582-4cbc-b2de-e046123897cf,It is a really good personal app for those who seek change and improvement on their healing journey. You just need to be committed and keep up with the schedule you yourself made.,4

Like day 3... it doesn't feel like just another motivation app. I like how they take the time to explain things as towards why small changes leads to bigger changes in regards to the habits that you want to change. At the end of the day no one can make you change but yourself. But this app helps you to stay focused.",4
b3a2c223-b51b-4841-bdb0-037905c387eb,Its been nice to have the support from the app. I havent been faithful to doing this daily as of yet.

There are different paths to choose and you get extra info, challenges, community etc. For that I give 5+ stars. Where it loses points is the tech. There are several things that go wrong but most annoying is the issues I'm having with the processing of subscription offers.

It helps keeping your eyes at the goal and by using friendly nudges for every small milestone you feel accepted and find motivation to keep going. Overall a very nice application and I hope that it stays as helpful as it is right now for me.,4
a29eb5fa-4e7a-4d6c-a6a6-d3aa72080e40,A very good app it works great but its bad that the scam you on your first free week because they dont let you add more than 4 tasks to your list if you whant more stuff to do. In my opinion this app should have an option were you can pay for it or where you can use it for free as much as you whant with the same tasks you would get if you paid for it.,4

I think it's a really helpful app, and this kind of help is very important in today's age.

It wasn't until I got through their questionnaire that it even told me it cost anything. At that point I went ahead and signed up for the trial anyway, but it still didn't tell me how much I was going to be billed afterward. I had to hunt down that information. $40.

The daily words of encouragement are soothing, and the notifications that pop up for morning, afternoon, and night routine help to keep me on track. Only downside is that I don't think you can change the daily routine reminders for each day, which doesn't work for me since I work nights during the week (which is my main routine), but I'm awake during the day on weekends with another routine.",4

2883bf07-faca-49f5-8549-6e555bc6859e,It does cost money but it's fairly affordable and after the free trial I decided to keep using it. It's less about dieting or exercise or other goals and more about show life changes. It's manageable and engaging and I really love the soothing voices.

Unlike some of the others I've used, Fabulous teaches you how to go about setting your habits in a productive way, one step at a time! Although this app resonates with me, I can't recommend it to anybody who isn't dedicated to self improvement. A resistant mindset will only ruin the experience! Change must come from within, and this app is just a tool to help you get there!",4

Some improvements though: - dark mode - I use it at night a lot because that's when I get to unwind - group notifications - by 1pm I have 5 notifications from Fabulous, I wish they were grouped like email notifications so they take less space. Also new messages from Circles, do we really need notifications? I see lots of users replying with ""how do i stop notifications?""",4

I was hesitant to accept because I knew I would be charged if I didn't cancel in time. But it coaxed me into a sense of safety because it said I would be notified before I was charged. I should have set an event in my calendar as well but since the app was highly rated I think I felt pretty safe that I would be notified before I was charged for an annual subscription. Fast forward a week and I still have premium features but no notice... maybe my free membership got extended to a month? It seemed plausible because month long trials also exist in this app. Then I realized my card got charged. I tried to apply for a refund through the app developer and the play store but so far both have denied the request. I did technically get an email from the play store which I found after digging through my email but it got filtered away from sight so I just feel like I was a little bit tricked into subscribing because I was honestly expecting a push notification so that I could then decide if I wanted to buy it or not. So just be careful. Otherwise it's not a bad app.",4

Not just a to-do list w/reminders. - Odd auto-generated text for reminders can break the immersion. Navigation is not always clear.

I've never been a motivated person, there's nothing I love more than bed, but I've been up early every day these week!

The only thing I wish was different is the pay wall. I'm willing to pony up some money for it because I can and I can feel that it's helping my ADHD/depressed/anxious self, but I wish it was more accessible to people who struggle with similar issues and don't have the means to pay for apps, let alone therapy or prescriptions. ♡",4

a4da52a8-9b25-40b7-a716-e7b7375f8c3c,This app acts as a great kickstarter for new habits (initially over 3 day period) which you have to tick off daily in order to move up to a new set of challenges. I'm now stuck on a new set of challenges with a much longer timescale which I can't pass unless I tick off each completed item daily. If I miss a day I lose my 'streak' and have to start over. Please can the developers include a little margin for slacking to keep us motivated over longer challenges.,4

It has a lot of potential, and I love the feature of being able to check off the things I've done. Now just gotta stick with it",4

The starting small with water thing annoyed me a lot, because I need to see the end goal. I am hyperactive and wanted to take on the final stage from the start, because that's my way. I play Dark Souls. I hate my self, because I am just shy of perfect in an imperfect way. I move fast and break things. And then fix them if they can be fixed.

After the first 3 days (consecutive) of drinking water you can add on a new part of your routine or it will ask if you want to add the new goal eat a great breakfast. It doesnt do it right away because it wants you to start slow so you don't get overwhelmed and ""jump off the wagon"".

68a7962b-d05e-4c44-b2a5-2ad7dd37ad4f,Rlly useful app. I love how they break down habits into micro goals which are achievable and improve your overall wellness. Only improvement I would suggest is that I find the app a bit confusing to navigate. This app has changed how I think about goal setting. Highly recommend,4
20929f43-b4f4-423e-8fb1-c296465e8be4,"Pros: Simple goals that support lasting change, good coaching tools, easy reminders to stay motivated. Definitely one of the best of it's kind Cons: It's much more helpful in the beginning- the response of help feature is poor, the app isn't always intuitive leaving you stuck on a journey sometimes, there's no option to do things a few times a week (all or nothing)",4

The only thing that I noticed could be improved was when implementing the goal to unplug and avoid screens before bed, the relaxing audio with bird calls and a stream flowing is very difficult to hear unless you turn your volume to 100%, and when the time is up, the noise of the timer is extremely loud in comparison. It woke me up a few times. Other than that everything is great!",4

The feedback response was useful for getting the chime to stop in the settings, however it is still linked to the sound, so I don't get the interruptions in the meditaions and such, but it is still verry quiet.

5fad2282-567b-4fed-892f-c5417650e88e,Installed the app after seeing the almost perfect rating + great reviews. The sign-up started off ok but I was hit with a week trial/paywall before I even saw my personalized plan. That was a bummer bc the platform looked good. I still gladly pay $90 ish/yr for Headspace bc I was able to use it in a limited capacity for a bit until I was 100% sold without them pushing the sub on me.

3ffcb661-a140-48c3-950c-244e224ace32,This is a surprising app that sort of builds overtime. There is a lot of thought and information embedded in the app. It slowly motivates the user to build routines overtime. At first it seems wordy and filled with flourishes but it grows on you.

These are mini-experiences that gently shift your thinking, your perspective, get you moving a little, and move you out of your various ruts throughout the day. You add tiny steps as you are ready.

05e78c7d-ef85-41d8-8fed-f14082ed3eab,It's early days yet but I like the simplicity of the challenges. It's mostly stuff I know but it's still useful and gently motivating. I would rather wait before passing things on and could do with less requests to do that. However all in all I like this app . 'The challenge of simplicity' Maggie Nicols quote.,4
5662eafa-5fbe-4d95-9525-4f1cdf533d0f,"Pros: engaging, guided, helps you to form healthy habits/routines. Cons: very prescriptive, makers have obviously used psychological techniques to make the app addictive",4

cb08f4db-ad94-43a1-b80e-5533338376e9,"I feel like this app prays on my anxiety with guilt trips to try to help me fix issues. For instance, when I accepted a challenge instead of asking if I wanted to have a fried help with accountability it asked ""would you like to share your goal with a friend"" or ""I don't want to be held accountable "".",4

It's easy to use, easy to stick to, and the interface is really good. It's got many uses and goals, it's really versatile and personalisable. I do find it can try to guide too much, but I'm a very self led personal improver. It really does help and have great ideas. I love this app and recommend it to friends. It can be persistent in trying to get you to share it, I've only used word of mouth really.",4

I think the format/interface of the app is a little odd, making it difficult at times to navigate. I could see some people not liking it because it's cartoon-ish, so maybe I'm the future there could be a setting to make everything look more serious for professionals.",4
c358924a-010c-4510-9114-eb2aff44018d,"I think this app is great. My only frustration is needing to pay for certain amenities on the app. I get they need income, it's just frustrating for a self-help app. Also there isn't a whole lot of direction with their more abstract behaviors. Like there's something about ""completing your golden triangle"" but legitimately no description that I can find that explains what the heck that means. All in all though, I think the app is motivational and will be a positive influence in my life.",4

The interface can be a little confusing and frustrating at times though. I didn't realize you couldn't do challenges and journeys simultaneously, which caused a challenge to stay on my homepage. I couldn't delete it and even when I tried to restart the challenge, it just added a duplicate habit. I couldn't delete it either so I've redownload the app to start over.",4

Sorry to learn this is a spinoff from an already succussful prev. app. It just makes me want to uninstall this app & forget it & its forerunner as well. Haven't tried the meditation yet, but the reviews re: rushing, voice, were concerning. Maybe you hv to upgrade & pay $$. It's always disheartening to tap a feature, only to find out it requires a purchase. The graphic & music are lovely, the water sounds when you scroll up are a cute & nice touch.",4
bea42ff9-052b-48a3-884c-49ac2fb084e3,Keeps me on track and gives me encouraging notifications when I do forget or get off track. Plus has little story times when you complete a challenge. 10/10 would reccomend,4
e113d06f-cf6d-453a-8706-e03d84ac79ac,Enjoyed the older version better when you didn't have to pay to add more habits but other than that still love it,4
54f56bde-8c79-4ffe-84b7-f2a74e64bd44,Fun and intuitive app. Making small changes one at a time and adding new ones slowly feels much easier. The app provides a lot of interesting information and guidance.,4

614c2fb9-a929-4d8a-850b-493dbf5a565f,I have only been using this app for a few days. The visual appearance and sounds are enticing almost like a game. I enjoy the informational reads that are provided at the beginning of each challenge and the analogies used to really help me think about things in a different way. I am only using the free version and dont care for the constant pop ups to go premium but it is not overly obnoxious. I'm excited to see how things continue to move forward.,4

However they don't do refunds after you upgrade to premium if you think the app doesn't work for you. Which to me does not make much sense because it's not that I benefited from the app. I tried it, I paid the full year, after 2 months I realized I can't commit my routine to an app. So in the end I have gained almost nothing from it. I'd be ok with paying only the months I've been using the app.",4

It helps direct habits I want to pick up and I personally would say it's more up to yourself to have the motivation and willpower to get the tasks done in the app and not get lazy with them.

922ee00b-0fdc-43d0-ac7a-c2e24fdbd5c6,I like the app. I use Premium. Bit cheesy at times but friendly and nags you to get in to good habits. I need that reminding so it works really nicely for me. Starts small and builds you up. The reason for 4 star instead of 5 is that it constantly pushes you to get other people to sign up. Too hard a sell for my liking. I don't want to be asked again after I say no the first time.,4

Otherwise app works well and never glitches. Love it.,4

000451c8-aa14-498d-b8e2-0b9756a8e074,I love the app it helps me to really feel organized. However once you already put in your morning routine you cannot change the structure or order and I really wish that you could because I was selecting things as they were coming to mind but not in the order that I would like to do it. Other than that I absolutely love the app it puts everything in a time frame so I know how much time I'm actually working with it,4

It can feel a bit tedious managing the tasks but I was writing everything down before so not an issue. I'm really enjoying this app and will likely pay the yearly price to try it and see how far I get in a year's time. Be back in a year with an update I guess lol,4

The only negative so far really grinds on me, unfotunately. The music fades out really nicely but starts up quite jarringly.

But only if it is cheap. And as I am a heavy apps and games explorer, I think the apps with cheap plans will will have better chance of buying as most of the users don't want to spent much on apps unless he is rich.

Pretty helpful giving me more structure and reminders for the little things.,4

c52a839c-b565-40ac-a970-8e56b1167be4,"Fantastic app for keeping track of daily routines and facilitating motivation to ""not break the chain"" (i.e. not break the routine""). However, there is one major flaw. Routines that require a schedule other then daily are forgotten about. For example, you can't track a weekly routine such as call a family member. The app requires you to do this daily, which for some is a bit much. I hope the developers can fix this!",4

d27c9c9a-06b0-4b49-942f-17f4904f54a9,"Back in 2016 I enjoyed this app and it helped me a little bit. I've hit a rough patch and can't even afford much at the moment so I remembered how friendly the Fabulous app was. Sadly, its changed to fit our society where good mental health is equivalent to money. Features that were once free are premium (i.e 3 habits for one alarm if I am remembering correctly you could do a lot more previously, though I could be wrong). There isn't even a list of actual Premium benefits rather a why to buy.",4

It's motivated me to get on with things I would normally put off and has encouraged me to make my routines more purposeful. My only frustration is that I don't take my phone upstairs at night as I have a tablet (and don't like to be distracted by calls and messages). When I downloaded the app onto the second device they don't seem to sync so I have to tick off my routine in the morning instead....,4

It uses positive and encouraging words and has lots of great meditation features and exercise plans. Only downside is there is no option to pay monthly you have to pay for a year premium. Also puts you on premium by default not giving an option of what the free version contains.

For sure knowing that the team has brought Dan Ariely onboard adds much respect as well as a sense of authority to the app. You can see a lot of his insights throughout the app. But for my flow Fabulous is overdoing it in some parts and lacks in others. WHAT I LIKED: 1. great number of improvement ideas 2. useful and relevant hints on how to make a habit stick or how to lose one 3. well structured: you create routines and under them you can add specific habits 4. app is flexible and has many features - ""Discover"" tab is nicely done and structured WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: 1. app is ""heavy"". Even if you turn sounds off, every interaction brings up full-screen animations, you have to wait, then go through several other screens that congratulate you. It takes time to go through all that. And if you have several routined or if you postpone something then it only adds up Suggestion: add ""light mode"" that would add just an easy check-boxes list that I can quickly go through. All on one screen. Maybe even without bringing the app up to full screen 2. Interface is overloaded with colors even despite you trying to keep it simple and 'material'. Too many colours and boxes. That is distracting. And I need to focus on the app every time because there are new cards popping up. Suggestion: make the first screen only with what is valuable NOW 3. list of routines and checkboxes. (you can add a small link next to every habit is there is something really useful) 4. Animations and images are creative, but I don't like them much. Also, if this app is meant to represent user's inner self on the path of improvement then it should be possible to make the character to at least resemble you or at least be less obvious that it isn't you (make it not a person). Suggestion: Add some different options for animations/images if you insist on showing them for everyone to be able to relate better Also, I have dropped you my CV, so if you'd like to get in touch - you can reach out.

Pros: It has been beautifully designed. It simply looks great. It's functionality is mostly very intuitive Cons The voice overs are reallllllly annoying.

0c03f767-07bf-4cc0-85c8-e9730b25ac1d,I've just started using Fabulous and so far I really like it. It follows a sound behavioral philosophy and provides LOTS of encouragement. It really addresses why we don't stick with good habits and works with you every day to make them stick (hint: baby steps). Using the app is a little confusing to start but I've stuck with it for almost a week and the layout or setup is starting to be more familiar.,4

e56d1942-a793-4f09-ba41-a8fd9a864638,"The guys who made this app are evil masterminds. Here's why: 1. They say it costs just a little per week/month, but charge you upfront for the entire year. 2. You need to cancel your subscription by the end of the 6th day, but it isn't clear when the 6th day ends. Is it inclusive of the day you joined? They dont send you a reminder either. 3. Even on the paid plan you need more than 7 days to explore locked sections of the app. So the free trial is essentially just to enter your card details. It doesn't really let you try anything. This way they trick you into buying the whole year. I can recognize a ""dark design"" pattern. I am surprised that this is an ""Editors Choice"" . Perfect example of dark design patterns. People are getting haggled and they dont realize it. Leaving a 4 star review because this isn't a rant, just putting it out there.",4

008630d3-c345-411e-afea-7d8b551249b3,"the app is fantastic. the only issue i find is that they expect you to make an upfront payment for the full year subscription. somehow, it was implied as a monthly payment, and I agreed to that, but a full year payment? i don't have the cash for that, and there's no option to switch for the monthly plan. this way, it seems like it's their way or no other way. i don't buy your ""take care of me"" if that's the case.",4
52439f71-8e22-4f67-b7c4-3bb7042e2ef5,so far so good. the interface is not so intuitive though,4
d7d9e97e-018f-4740-a6fa-af67298c85cd,you get 7 day free trial an then after that you have to pay for the app but it actually helps keep you on track an to declutter an to have healthy habits it's actually really good app an the quotes or inspiration is really helpful when your struggling it's easy to use constant help only thing is you gotta do it! first week is hard but after 30 days you'll notice a difference,4
dcbfafbd-bf9c-4eb7-af53-c8d22c8e8546,it got me into habit in to get more organizing and healthier,4

4388c5cf-2541-44ea-8d58-722359f1359e,"A little expensive but helpful for managing my depression. I was diagnosed with depression last year and its been an uphill battle. Still have bad days but forming good habits helps fortify me a lot against depression. The habits I chose help keep my space clean and body healthy, so its harder to get caught up in an endless loop of being sad and not being able to get out of bed and being sad because I never do anything. Not saying this app ""cured"" me. But its a wonderful tool in my toolbox.",4
190fa117-23d3-4806-8047-f8d8776a5f72,Dont understand what everyone is complaining about. I have not paid for the app (yet) but find it very useful. Maybe others are just in a rush to build a full morning routine immediately instead of taking it one habit at a time as they suggest.,4

ae333d27-1bfb-48c6-9d89-84da40820bc5,a very good app for allowing a person to better ones self. you must be prepared to give it a chance and make a commitment to it though. marked 4/5 as the occasional technical glitch on my Pixel 2,4

Also, as far as I can tell you cannot add your own habits, but have to rely on their step by step curated habits.

43b340c6-7c39-44ef-8243-b70704fad974,"After 1 week of being reminded to drink water, $49 will be deducted from your account immediately and due for another deduction the next year, that's pretty much what to expect if you don't cancel in time - judging by how sketchy after sales is, there's a high chance you won't be able to cancel the trial either and still lose your money! No refund is available from Google play and non-fab app, the responses to all reviews should give you an indication how this story ends :) Hope this helps.",4

cf18f427-d4fb-4b5a-93ad-316df609e787,I really wanted to love fabulous. It sounded great. What put me off from the start is that the app tries you to help promoting it right away by liking their Facebook page and by keep trying to convince you to go premium before exploring the app fully.

The notification settings are clunky and I forgot to cancel the subscription before it I had to pay for one year and that was the final straw for me and decided to uninstall.,4

46277414-10f6-4b92-9524-31342b057b32,"I really like the ease of building and tracking rituals. it seems like there is a lot of additional functionality in this app that isn't intuitive, so while I love what I keep finding, I'm pretty sure that I could be using it better. For example, I tried changing the duration of a pre-set task, couldn't figure it out, and just assumed it couldn't be changed. I figured it out accidentally today while removing an extra habit that I wasn't quite ready to implement.",4

The reminders are subtle, however for a few days it was duplicating my notifications after I said I done the task it would pop up again. Would give it a 4/5, but it's only been the beginning. Will update again after using it for a while.",4
d96d926f-3e58-4010-8328-2230d5d86145,"Overall the app is well made and I love that it has encouraging ""letters"". I also love that it offers to remind you the night before so that you can prepare for the goal at hand.

198defc1-7bef-46d2-8139-efeaee00608d,"update: The fabulous app had been an invaluable tool for my personal growth and helped me successfully control nervousness or redirect anxiety surrounding my depression. The requirement to start out slow and build on your achievements over time helped with not becoming overwhelmed by change. The user experience can be a challenge initially, seems designed to keep pace with your progress, to not let users jump ahead.

73ea3515-a5dd-471f-b2b9-f996591511fd,this app is a good way to introduce new habits I've been wanting to start anyway. I don't think it would help someone who hadn't already thought of improving themselves.,4
6bdf645a-8404-4fc7-b53f-fc055a02d5a8,surprisingly good. I struggle with motivation and with this app I'm reminded of what I should be doing but as a busy mum who works full time I often forget about ie- drink some water when I wake up,4

I also really like the design of the UI it's very vibrant and organized (and super extra points that one of the icons for one of the habits is a pokeball lol). The app is only a planner and alarm/task reminder system (with some motivational letters and messages).

c8466ddb-64e5-4fbd-8a6e-6e7a2e8cba4d,I really like the potential of the app. Most things are behind a paywall or I would rate it higher. Things slowly are unlocking but it is unclear how useful the app actually is because I have no sense of what all is unlockable in free mode. If most of it stays locked then it's less useful than other apps on the market and deserves a lower rating. This is a service I would consider paying for if more were included. It is relatively new though so it is hard to guage.,4

5a7de98b-5326-43a8-b326-5c8ecfb7d4d2,This is a long term commitment so why advertise as a free app when you only get a week free before having to pay a MONTHLY subscription. So I guess the app works! My well-being is improved already because I didn't waste £££ every month.,4

5f3f64fc-0a2a-4ff4-9cd6-4748caa52afe,this app is definitely encouraging me to create routines and i have been doing many of the activities that i wanted to do but sometimes lacked motivation. my only issue with the app is that as soon as you finish one activity it starts the timer for the next one. it's not easy to go from flossing to reading in a fraction of a second! and i cant remember the order of activities so i have to go to the next one and pause it and then prepare. i wish that i could just start the timer when i was ready.,4

79b64286-85e2-49a7-8ee1-a6ae36683787,This is a really cool app but I kinda got confused trying to find where to set my routines cus I like being in control of these things. After I figured out where to find routines after Ive made them this app became a lot more enjoyable. I also wish the interface wasnt cluttered with notifications. I know its part of how its designed to get you to read and feel inspired and understand the principles but again they ended up doing that at the cost of functionality. Maybe add a notification button?,4

Unfortunately, I was really struggling health wise at the time, and was only able to use it for a few weeks. Every now and then I have revisited this app, with the intention of finally commiting to it. But today I opened it, and to my dismay, the app offered a one week free trial, and a following fee of almost 50 dollars per year. I don't know how long ago this change was made, or the reasons behind it, but I had to change my 5 star rating, as I can see the app has changed.

It honestly helped SO MUCH, but my problem with it was that a lot of people with depression like me sometimes, I dunno, forget to eat. And I had anorexia on top of that, so yeah. My point is with a lot of us, we actually need MORE calories, instead of LESS calories, because we really haven't been eating enough. So I feel like it would be seriously awesome if you put a simple little question in the beginning, like, you know, are you trying to A. Lose weight B. Gain weight C. Keep your current weight Just some suggestions I had. But, all in all, thank you SO DANG MUCH FOR CREATING THIS APP. IT LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE WHEN I HAD DEPRESSION AND COULDN'T AFFORD A THERAPIST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. And if anyone out there is thinking about ending their life and is looking for a sign not to, this is it. Don't kill yourself. DON'T KILL YOURSELF. PEOPLE DO CARE. I CARE.

727f9d9b-4dff-4fe3-aee5-8f5e044024b3,"The first habit was really easy. Just drinking water in the morning. Keeping in mind I had this habit before but I stopped. This got me back into that habit. I think starting with easy habits helps because most if us want to really change right away but it often frustrates us to the point that most quit so its good thing to start easy and lightly. Before this app, I had already started exercising in the morning a long time ago so the first week so far has been relatively easy. I dont know how well it would work with people that have never had these habits in the first place. The breakfast part helped me eat healthier tho. Some features I suggest they should add. They should allow the habit routines to be customized to time and order. For example I drink water first but afterwards I have to feed my cats. And only then do I exercise and afterwards I have breakfast. I cant eat my breakfast and then exercise. It gives me a stomach ache. I wake up at 5 am to drink water and it takes me half an hour to do the chores in my house for a bit. Then I come back to it. It would be nice if it allowed you to adjust the schedule a little more once you've gotten used to it. Another feature would be connecting to exercise apps so that part would be more convenient. I'm also working on bettering my drawing skills. It would be cool if it had profession habits. What habits artists do, how much they practice in order to achieve their results. And what they practice and how. I think that would be an amazing add on to an already good app. They could try that with other professions too that require practical repetition more than studying. Because lets be honest, trying to track someone's studying is tricky. Making them repeat actions to better their skills is easier. Overall, a great app. Its easy to use, good layout and helps you prepare for your habits. That helps a ton. Because often apps just tell you what to do. But this app really tried to make sure you actually do them by making you prepare yourself for them. Like buying ingredients for your breakfast. Putting a glass of water next to your bed the night before. These differences are what sets this app apart from all other apps I've seen so far. I highly recommend it!",4

I missed the daily encouragement and discipline, the mind-set it fosters and the empowerment I feel every time I complete a goal. I note that the developers added a feature to allow me to program my own rituals, which I suggested in my original review, so I have to say thank you so very dearly. Now, I would like to ask for you to connect with Google fit. I find that the more apps I have tracking my information, the more accurate that info is, and the more motivated I am to complete my goals and push myself forward. I suggest Google fit because I'm already comfortable using it, and it actually connects to other apps I use as well - further enhancing my overall experience and the accuracy of my information. I recently began a trial for an app similar to this one, just for the sake of curiosity, and I found that, unequivocally, I prefer the artistry and science behind the Fabulous. My last note is really the only one that matters, though, and it's this: thank you, Fab team and all who had a hand in this, for creating something so personally empowering. *original review* Great behavioral modification app, soothing music and visuals to reinforce new good habits.

829d132c-7453-4d78-b990-4d478d30e391,Enjoy the habit forming of this app - definitely notice myself being more mindful of healthy routines. Constantly being asked to go to premium is really taking the joy out of it though. Having a homescreen that has multiple sections that all lead back to - upgrade and pay us please - feels really pushy and takes away from the genuineness of the goals for the app.,4

efe6411e-2300-4462-85d0-3df2f2ce891e,"I've been using the free version so far to track and improve my morning routine and try to establish an evening routine. I find it pretty useful, and i like it that i can make my own activities to add to a ritual. I've recommended it to some friends as an unseful tool. But it does use quite a bit of battery. If you turn off the app the alarms won't start, so you have to let it run in the background. I've also noticed that it keeps the screen always on. That's not great for the phone, especially if you add an activity like deep work which takes say 45 mins. You can turn off the screen manually, but there is no setting that allows you to configure the app to turn off the screen after the designated device timeout. It would be better if the screen turned off like for any other app, and then say it would turn on again when the timer for the activity expired or smth like that. Or at least give the user the option to turn that on or off. Also, there are a few glitches like sometimes in the middle of my morning ritual it will go back to another activity i had already completed and i'd have to mark it as done again... All in all it's an useful tool. Idon't know about the subscription though... 15€/month is a lot! Audible is cheaper, and you get an actual book every month, which to me is much better value than some micro coaching exercices you can't even all use (one journey at a time, plus really who has time to do100 rituals a day)...",4

If it were a one off payment, I might consider it, given the results, but £45 is not an amount of money I have to spend every year on an app and the monthly instalment version of £25 per month is just daylight robbery in comparison.

I also admire Dan Ariely (Duke Center's director where the app was created and is managed...he also is the creator of the organization, Lemonade for those of you that need rental insurance). The only thing is that sometimes I get annoyed with apps that pop up to remind me of stuff, so I subconsciously close it or don't tell like doing it sometimes. If you can sick with it consistently for 30 days, I can see how it would transform your daily choices, thus your life. Even with not sticking with it, it makes you more conscious of the things you want to work on and brings awareness, which is the first step.

I dont like that the app needs to be launched for the reminder. It seems like it would be easy to ignore if you wanted. I also wish it were more customizable. The premium version might be a bit better but it is extremely expensive for an app. I dont think most people would pay over $20 for an app and the premium version is way more.

Also, I really find it nice that they start with small goals which would probably install the appreciation and confidence in us to make and keep a habit. It works on the character, instead of just making us do certain tasks. Kudos to the team for creating a delightful app.",4

cab65d25-bb39-4923-ba70-5077fb505a15,"The whole concept of this app is really great, and the graphics/design definitely do deserve the award. Very engaging and gets you to think about what you're doing. But the research is flawed in some cases (e.g. the entire idea about breakfast has been mostly debunked with recent research. You should not start eating breakfast if you already eat right and usually skip it). It would be cool if the app were continuously updated based on current research. The other problem is that whoever wrote the copy for it clearly had English as a second language. The grammatical errors are minor, but they make it harder for me to take the app seriously and there are some weird sentences a native speaker would never say. Constantly including my name in the copy makes it feel creepy and awkward. The other thing that bothers me is the assumption that your life is a complete mess before you start using the app, which is condescending. I already drink water every morning-- why does automatically start me on that for three days? What if I already don't keep junk food in the house? All this could easily be eliminated with a startup survey so the app is adjusted to your level.",4

Habits are great, but should not increase stress if something can't be completed in that moment. Some people have to skip a habit from time to time...especially due to illness or injury.

CONS: *Monthly fee vs straight UPGRADE ADD purchase for full ver. *With last UPGRADE ADD upgrades (ver 3.44/3.43) LARGE increase in Sphere adds. I'd say 4 out of 5 click points are for this upgrade/purchase. UPGRADE ADD Reverted back to 3.42, get an app/apk back up app *Not user friendly if you don't follow the UPGRADE ADD system they've laid out *Cannot create your own UPGRADE ADD multistage habits. (As used in stretching, breathing, etc) *Would be nice if the UPGRADE ADD hot key/icon also made rituals available not JUST challenges and upgrade adverts. *Art work is mundane.

I find myself waking up earlier because I am excited to continue my streak of completing the routine. I like how it builds gradually from drinking water to eating a healthy breakfast, to incorporating a few minutes of exercise. One downside, which may actually be a feature (I haven't decided), is that it kind of throws you into your journey without a lot of explanation. This may actually be a good thing because I am motivated to unlock new content. The app is sometimes not the most intuitive. You have to fill out the exercise and meditation journals before you check off the habit, which I found confusing at first. It might be helpful to have little tutorial pop ups the first time you use a feature. These potential drawbacks are pretty minor and it is certainly worth the little bit of time it takes to get used to how things work.",4

Why yes, I care very deeply about successful white men. Morning routine is the only key to success. Sociology is basically astrology, right?... I bet all those dudes drank water for success every morning... Like Michael Jordan's Secret Stuff in Space Jam, it was water all along. 2 minutes into using this and already irritated enough to be having a one way sarcastic conversation with my tablet. Closed it before Amber finished. Thanks but clearly this is not my cup of tea or water. But if it helps you, then that's great. Really. Everyone needs to find things that help motivate them.

Yes, there is a 50% discount offer at the time I'm writing this but my statement still stands. I understand that it takes a lot of time and effort that goes into the making, especially in such a detailed app like this. But maybe if there were different levels of payment? For example, if you pay this much you unlock a couple of things, or pay the full amount you get everything. Some people may be willing to pay the full price and that's great, good for them.

The purpose of this app is to help people but I hope you can consider the fact that not everyone can actually have that much amount of money especially for a student like me, please consider this so that a lot of people can actually buy it. You'll have a huge profit if you continue with your current but it would be much better to lower it so that more people can actually buy/use/try this app to the point of actually continuosly using it, in that way more people would be able to recommend this to their friends and say,""hey, try this out.

I had used this app previously, but I tried to speed things along a little by adding one or two additional habits to the routine, before the app itself had advised me to. I crashed and burned because I was trying too much at once. Trust me, one at a time is the way to go! I didn't make it this far the last time. Edit: This app is still doing me good!

The reminders and the blurbs explaining why the approach is how it is are cool too. The positive comments are corny sometimes. The WORST was when I got a ""Cerificate of Achievement"" before I actually did anything. It made me feel patronized. Random pop ups that have nothing to do with my set goals are annoying, but don't happen very often. Sometimes it double confirms you will do a habit the next day and that is annoying. I'm an adult, not a preschooler. On the other hand, I wish it had me do my 1st habit more than 2 or 3 days before adding a new one. I would prefer 5 days because I can be inconsistent with new routines. Overall very helpful and an attractive interface. I recommend trying it.",4

For me ...there are days I work and days I dont and on the days I work my routine is different then on the days I dont.

Over the last year l have tried to reach them using what little contact info I could find but they dont contact me. Even tried googling the Center for Advanced Hindsight (or whatever their cutesy name is) without luck. I have questions but can't get answers. I know I could get more out of the program but cannot figure out how and can't get any help. Have only been using the program for four days, but it is already very helpful in keeping me organized and helping me remember important things that I otherwise forget like eating and taking medication and celebrating my life.

The only big problem I'd have with it would be that during the challenges I can't skip one of I already had the habit. For example I've had to wait 3 days to finish the drinking water challenges when I've already been doing that since forever so it adds nothing to my morning routine. I've added some new habits next to it for the morning routine just to make myself obey a ritual. I love the coaching sections, even though all the exercise sections are way too intense for someone who's just started or who has illnesses. Still,great app and plenty to do without the paid subscription.",4
f55a571a-f001-4163-bd2b-e9b7094dcfb4,As someone with ADHD and bipolar this app really did help make the daunting task of routine establishment managible and even easy. I thought it was silly at first just drinking water but it was worth sticking it out because once I got the water thing nailed it was easy to add other stuff onto that habit. I also like how it let's you snooze the routine without negative consequences. It's a very encouraging app. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I would prefer a one off payment option instead of a subscription.,4

Most the time I want to do something but, I'm reminded at the wrong time by other apps and you have the choice of complete it or don't with those. Overall looks good!

I've been using the app since it's beta development and the team responded to my feedback and made the improvements I suggested. I've given it 4 instead of 5 stars purely because of the price of the premium version 'Sphere', which has amazing features but is unfortunately out of my price range, even with the 50% discount for the first year. Definitely recommend though and definitely try the free trial!",4

Also, it's backed by science and explains everything along the way. Still has a few kinks to work out, though. For instance, you can't add an activity multiple times to a ritual. For instance, say I have to take my meds twice in the morning. Then I have to create a separate ritual for the second time because I can't have ""take medicine"" twice in the same ritual. A couple of the audios also stop playing after a minute. Still,this is overall a great app and I'm looking forward to continuing to use it and its updates.",4

I don't like that it starts to try and sell you sphere in the first day and even week .. I don't want a count down on a discount on my pay for something that I haven't figured out works yet .. and yea I can just keep the free part but I would still like the discount when I figure out it works .. I've just made it to the 3rd habit (the one I want to change the most) that's one that will make me want more from this app and I have no problem paying when I see this awesome app can help me, but I have to know it can help me first .. the price is a bit much but I figure it's because not enough people are into this in order to profit off a more economic amount",4

aff015ca-6571-4da9-b08f-9215c3b89e48,I really like this app. It starts small with attainable objectives to assist you in developing good routines. The music is nice and so are the motivational letters. Intervention seems research based with citations and quotes from recognizable historians and successful business owners. The only thing I don't like is the constant reminders that you can buy a one year subscription. That part is annoying.,4

f936451b-82a3-4be3-bad8-1180619c6b47,I really enjoy the app except where it keeps telling me to invite an accountability partner. Surprise I've tried having a partner before and it didn't work. So take that out of the daily equasion and it's five stars. My accountability partner is the app that reminds me every day to do the things I'm trying to do to improve myself.

5aabcab4-415b-476e-88c9-d073a09929a4,I really liked it to begin with. It was easy to use and the format is really fun and pleasing to the eye. Then an advert popped up for a subscription... but it's ok! You can opt to 'never see it again'. Except you will. Again and again and again. It will be the first item on the page. It will come up repeatedly as a notification on your phone. You'll get motivational 'letters' on the app which halfway through reveal themselves to be another ad. Look it's a nice concept but I'm perfectly capable of setting alarms on my phone to remind myself to complete a positive habit without irritating adverts.,4
31f34cec-5c97-49b6-903a-b658f69a87ef,I really enjoy this app mainly because it holds me accountable with reminders. If your looking to be held accountable to make changes definitely a good app for that.,4

BUT the gentle reminders(when they work, I had vitamin reminders for 2 days then just randomly stopped) instead of annoying phone alarms and suggestions are very helpful, would think about subscribing in the future as imagine it being very useful if like myself you go through long periods of healthy habits and then something throws you off and little by little you forget to do things until your depression has kicked back in and you've missed your vitamins for 3 days etc",4

A little complaint is that it talks to you like you're a preschooler, even though it can help some people. The main thing that makes this work is just the amount of positive energy they pour into you through the text. You didn't do the thing? Don't worry, you're still doing great. You didn't do anything?

On the side, let people set reminders for a different rituals in the morning/afternoon/night because people don't really do all goals at once and some forget the next few by the time they're done.

The only improvement I could see, and the reason for the 4 stars, would be to allow me to pick rituals for certain days since my schedule is not the exact same everyday.

For example, letting us set it do on Sundays we sleep in and could start our rituals at 10 instead of 8 like all the other days. Besides that I love the app in every other way!

It hardly takes any time to set up and edit, and from there you can just let it run. It focuses on the benefits of forming habits and routines, but it doesn't force you to do things it's way. It will remind you to do tasks at certain times, but if you'd rather do them later, you have a checklist where you can check them off at any time. I would advise you to start by forming a few important habits, and form a morning routine first. Follow the app's suggestions, start small and work your way up to the point where you really have formed habits and routines that are second nature to you.

I love how well it inspires a person to develop healthy physical, emotional and mental habits; which also inspires discipline in general. The visual design is also easy to navigate and charming to look at. Great app!! The one issue I have is that when Fabulous opens up on screen as a page or as an alert icon, it will interrupt my display screen. So if I click on another app icon to open, I cannot open up my app. I have to either open Fabulous or close it in order to open any of my other apps. Or if Fabulous opens while my screen is on sleep, I cannot open the screen by tapping on it like usual. I could not power down my tablet, so I had to hit reset button to turn it off and power it back on. When it came back on, the time and date were wrong and I had to change it. Please fix this.

b8c4243d-c18e-4265-bea1-18042ec03c92,"Very colorful, clean motivation app that helps you build good habits nearly effortlessly. The app starts with small daily goals and your successes quickly snowball into larger and more impressive wins. It provides lots of value for just a few minutes of attention each day. For example, eating a healthy breakfast everyday was a struggle for me. Healthy means ""work"" and the last thing I want to do in the morning is cook and clean dishes. I ended up skipping breakfast most of the time, telling myself I wasn't ""in the mood"" to eat that morning. Or, on the rare occasion I actually felt hungry after waking up, I'd tell myself I ""don't have enough time"" to cook/clean. Instead, I'd buy sugary carbs on the way to work, which often led to a sleepy, sluggish afternoon. This app started me out with a deceptively easy task: drink water every morning for 3 days. It took me over a week to build up to my first 3 day streak. But, the digital confetti and encouraging words felt great to see. It's easy to forget to celebrate these little wins when you're focused on the end goal. Since then, I've progressed to eating a protein-rich breakfast everday and I'm working on building a new habit for light cardio in the morning. Exercise is not an everyday habit just yet, but this app gives me confidence that I'll get there one day soon.",4

The reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, as I feel it deserves overall, is the fear of loss (fol) tactics that litter the app disguised as well meaning next steps. I understand the need for revenue, and considering the quality of this app, this is not a deal breaker, but I find the psychological tricks used to clinch sales to be in like taste. That said, the points of sale are also non-intrusive. The total lack of apps is appreciated, and saves data. I Am a fan of this development team and may someday wosh to donate or purchase their services, as they are rooted in good, well meaning psychology ~ I'm on day 7 so far, this app is an elaborate way to force you into healthy mental habits. I'm very happy with it so far, no invasive adds or junk mail. Drinking water and making breakfast in the morning may seem obvious but it's something that gets left by the wayside in my generation. It's easy to forego the benefits of such simple actions, But the evidence is there for why these are great ways to start your day. As someone who is trying to get the most out of their day, this app is highly welcome, beautiful, and sets friendly reminders",4

Their approach mirrors that of my psychologist, which means no conflict in trying to establish routines, etc... and they have thought this one out with respect to ensuring your environment is changing to help you succeed (ie. If a main challenge is to have a healthy breakfast, there's a preliminary challenge to buy the necessary ingredients, etc... plus other options for different diets and lifestyles, and tips to ensure success). I've only been using it for a few days and, although it seems occasionally glitchy, it's not impacting its usefulness (eg. it's given me credit for a couple of challenges I haven't met yet, but I'll take the wins where I can get them! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:) I did sign up for Sphere straight away, which might have been premature, as my little timeline started getting very busy very quickly, but I'm happy to have Fabulous as part of Operation: Claire Gets Her S@#t Together :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",4

It is like a buddy I am accountable to. It helps me that the daily routines are called rituals as it is a positive word that suggests to me I'm doing myself s.th. good - which in fact I am! Have only used it for 3 days , so still struggling to find some of the functions & trying to adapt it to my needs. Is there a way to incorporate several different activities in say the morning ritual at DIFFERENT times? Will recommend this to friends.",4

c2f8246f-d683-4fdb-be25-ac2fa679e679,"This is a sweet app for helping develop focus and helping to instill beneficial daily habits. I've been a long time routine maker so the idea is nothing new to me. However, post a recent living situation upheaval and health crisis, I came across this app and decided to give it a whirl. It is fun, if a little elementary, and is an upbeat factor as I go to reordering my days. The interface took a few beats for me to suss an approach that made the app useful for me. This may be a generational thing, I'm not of the smartphone set, hate scrolling and I'm all about elegant minimalism in interface design. That said, this app does have a neat layout, restful to the eye a and the conventions used are probably more familiar to smartphone users. Also, the sounds are soothing, a nice touch in the morning for ingraining commitment to the routine I put together for myself-mainly, putting a lot of good, self-serving needs for myself ahead of launching into taking care of others. It's a good app for setting priorities. And it offers a cheerful note for anyone making a comeback from an illness or injury.",4

It's helping me again as I join the workforce. It's colorful and calming. It's easy to navigate and you learn how to use it quickly. I just wish it had a night mode, mostly. It would also be cool if you could choose different music/sounds to play while you do your routine. The music they have isn't bad my any means, but I might like reading a book or writing in my journal to the sound of a thunderstorm.

fbf131cc-cc93-4790-8120-1f1fe9160ea0,Amazing potential. I am currently on the 7 day trial considering the upgrade. The one-size-fits-all approach is an issue as there is a selective application of research that formulate their journeys. The inability to customise a journey limits the apps potential. The biggest issue is that their challenges are not updated by the tick box in the daily ritual. Pretty serious flaw after requesting you sign a commitment certificate! Otherwise the app is very attractive with great potential. Will be powerful in future if they can understand customisation does not dilute behavioural change. The free app is a good way to assess the paid version.,4

Now that I am paying for the app I do not feel much improvement from the free version. I think it needs a better menu cause it I'd difficult to figure out where is everything and something does not make sense like it tells me to exercise 3 days of the week o my 1st week of sphere but my alarm ask me to exercise daily or the ritual is not complete.

f534d0a6-eb19-459d-ab68-2c8fe17975a4,"The app design and fresh content keep the user interested. Other habit tracking apps only offer check boxes. Or timers. The user then is likely to think he doesn't need the app, tries on his own, and drops off.

Free app is good, shame so much of the additional good stuff is paid for. Some useful improvements would be: 1. The option to add your own notes to the tasks you include in your ritual e.g. reminding myself that as part of my grooming ritual I should tone and moisturise face would help build better habits 2.

We all love to think that we don't need it, but external motivation gets you going when you're not, and if you're looking to get this app, you're obviously not doing something on your own that you'd like to do. I like that it asks you when you wake up, then gives you a notification to do your things right then, with your alarm. I like that you can ignore the notification and come back to check it off later, too.

3e25fc28-5c27-4e93-bd82-b5b875e41a98,Really walks with you step by step. The only drawback is that it lacks the flexibility to custom some choices.

I think the approach and design is important because otherwise it can feel like a list of chores. Fabulous works at reinforcing small successes. Motivation then builds. Deceptively simple but actually very sound from a behavioural perspective. More importantly, i actually enjoy opening it up.

I'm on the first journey therefore I can't be totally ovjective on the overall app so my rating is subject to change. They not only tell you what to do but why to do it. The fact to subscribe could hold back some of you but consider that you invest in youself not only in the app. By committing to it you're more likely to achieve what should be hard otherwise. It's like going to the gym guys, not for your body only, but for all aspects of your life. I think it deserves the price.",4

It also does a great job motivating better behavioural changes like making lists and prioritising. I'll leave it at 5 stars and I'll come back if that changes! ----Edit 2 month later---- I have been using this for quite a while now and I gotta say it has changed my life. Even when I sometimes go down in a dysfunctional spiral and stop using it. It has helped me realise that it's not me I should blame, but my environment. The way to correct my behaviour is by making so the environment around me allow for those changes. It might seem like I'm trying to rid my self of the responsibility. But its the contrary, im finally letting myself see what the problem is and there for, I'm able to do something about it. I'm not lazy, I just prioritise wrong. Now I can seek out the real limiting factor and adjust it to make life work again, instead of blaming myself until I can't take it and just stop caring out of fear of failing again. I'm not dysfunctional anymore, im pretty fabulous (Sorry for the cheesyness) Also I started paying. I usually never pay for apps but this one is worth my money.",4

d6b55f21-3e8d-4356-8647-c4518b3a1fe1,"A tool for creating habits using several habit formation techniques. The primary method is employing a technique of developing tiny habits, such as drinking water, as an anchoring habit. Through this anchor, it adds somewhat more difficult habits to this anchor which tends to be more successful at creating new habits. There are a variety of helpful messages that motivate the individual or guides the individual to make the habit formation process more painless. I appreciate their focus on starting the day/ending the day off right before the journey continues to transform other aspects of life. One gripe I have is that there are no descriptions for the exercises and other ""Make Me Fabulous"" activities which is quite frustrating.",4

Can't wait to start the ""fabulous night"" journey, as I am terrible sleeper and struggle to get to bed early. Get this app, it's awesome! I never, never, ever pay for apps, but I signed up to the premium version in Jan 2017, sphere, mostly because this app is exactly what I need to motivate me, and its way better and cheaper than a therapist, and I want to ensure the developers are going to maintain this app. It's just that important to me! I did get a discount price of AUD5.99 per month for signing up by a particular date tho. JAN 2017: Really liking this app conceptually, although it's a bit buggy. I have been stressed at work for a long time and now feel burned out and I am now really struggling with motivation at work and at home, to have a good diet, around the house and to exercise, even to get out of bed in time to get my kids to school and me to work on time.

9037f8c6-2c31-4993-a5d9-6823d3f4fdc4,Self care app with great interface and functionality that is sometimes limited because of its targetted nature. No direct reason to not give 5/5 but a multitude of small issues that really dont add up or affect user exp. greatly. Great work overall.,4

The alarms work well and when it pops up on your screen it gets you to start the routine but you can easily exit or snooze it if you're not ready/don't want to. I really reccomend it. My only gripe is that there are not many different exercise routines, just one yoga, one stretch, and three workouts. But of course you can find these online yourself.",4

So far it is working. Drinking water 1st thing in the AM, eating a healthy breakfast, eating a serving of vegetables or fruit for lunch, making fish or nuts a staple a few times per week, etc. All habits I have made or am working towards making habits of already. But here is the thing...it is gradual. I tend tp want to take on everything right away. And if you want to, you can. But this app encourages one at a time and wont add more until you are doing well with the previous habit. I am trusting the process as it was made for me and it is working. I already feel better and each little triumph builds my confidence to go on to another challenge! I really am loving this app! Oh i almost forgot, there are mini programs you can do on the spot, like yoga or meditation or a quick workout, nap timers, concentration/work helper programs...THOSE alone are worth downloading for. The meditations are my favorite and really work.",4

I'm giving it 4 stars right now because I've only just started using it, however I do see the potential for 5. One thing I found so far that I did not like was the noise is makes when I click on a ritual and need to touch my phone. It sounds like ripping paper and is very loud and annoying. There was an option to turn it off though! But maybe they need to look at changing the sound effect.",4

It gives you very small steps to take towards your goal, steps that are completely reasonable and seemed to all be backed by science. No fads here. My one complaint is that sometimes the app doesn't register that you've completed a task, and you'll have to tell it several times that you did what it asked. Or it will register that you did the task on one section of the app, but not the other section. Once this is fixed, I will definitely be giving Fabulous 5 stars.",4

4b67e859-7356-4149-a13a-4f438ac86180,I have only explored the route for getting energized. The app starts small and grows on what you are doing. I have gotten far enough along that I have created my own routines for my own personal journey. I really like how much control you have over the different aspects. I also love the visuals!

I do this after I start my day and go back in and complete it. I would simply get up 30min earlier but having to change your schedule every 4 days to adjust to a different time zone takes a tole. When I'm at home eats easy to walk the dog and grap the paper and just go for a walk-we live in the country.,4

Beyond the initial setup (which is great for people starting out) it gets a little unclear how to continue using and developing it (it's not quite the app you can use to develop lots of habits - more like 2 or 3 key ones).

18c0da29-2bfe-4644-a729-94cc52dcb64d,"Just started using this last night. Reminds me a bit of SuperBetter, but less complicated. Still a bit confusing to navigate, but really like the concept.",4
55f52cfe-4b8d-4576-b5f7-825d754759a4,"Well, I installed this app quite randomly and the easy task it gave me just made me smile. At first I thought how pathetic, but what beautiful graphics. Soon enough I realized that, hey, using this costs me no energy, is very pleasant to look at and BAM, I am doing the stuff it suggests! Hard to say, what was first, the egg or chicken, cause at the time I started developing good habits and felt overall better, but I really enjoy this, the letters, the visuals. It's a very nice app.",4
9083944a-32af-4162-8fb0-d9e4a6698a3c,"I like most aspects of the app. I don't like that if I'm working on a ""night ritual"" and the time changes over to the next day, it starts counting the habbits I complete towards the next night instead of the current night and that i can't then go back to the previous night and add the things, nor can i undo the habits that accidentally got added to the wrong day. Also a widget that would show the ritual you are working on for a specific time of day or day that could be either in list form or expandable=:grinning_face:",4
f4fe3907-4a87-4948-a7f0-c9c09ab9662e,Helps me to keep motivated and focus on good thing throughout the day.,4
07aab997-6e83-4f06-b323-7ab99fed9767,I would give 5 stars if: 1. You could uncheck habits you accidentally checked but haven't done and 2. If you could go back to previous days and check habits that you forgot to check. So many times now I have been busy in the evening and realised too late (after midnight) that I didn't check things I did in the evening so it would be really nice to be able to click previous days and edit them,4
11e97ef7-9f58-4444-a6f7-1cd79ab5a375,"Been using this app for 2 weeks, mostly successfully. It's a fun (and motivating!) way to form a healthy routine. I get excited about mornings because I know when I finish drinking my water, doing yoga, eating a healthy breakfast, and exercising on the way to work, I'm going to feel great (and have a cheery little sense of accomplishment). 2 small issues to mention: 1. My Be Energized journey doesn't always update to reflect what I've done 2. I'd like to unlock a longer yoga routine than 7 minutes. Thnx! =)",4

e3cc3a5a-4a72-40e2-9e7f-bc2443d0191b,This apps makes me feel more health and also make my day more organized then yesterday. I think if this apps can show us health food recipe or the other health tips it would be great,4
3f716fd8-68de-4291-9271-31ee484586df,"I really love that it forces me to focus on certain tasks at different points in the day. I especially love the letters of challenges and encouragement. I think the app might be improved with some sort of unstuck module. Sometimes when I intend to do my ritual but am already exhausted from the day or am caught up by something else, I lose motivation. It would be really great if there was a module in which I could vent my frustration and find a suitable coping mechanism of action.",4

d341efa3-2eee-4fba-a264-933393a29a09,I try to use it everyday. There are days however where I feel too busy and have to break my morning ritual. Overall I like the progression and how it fits into my lifestyle.,4
ad9d1e36-28c8-4927-a4ed-ff0574b01548,Great so far! I'm really enjoying it. Some things are a little confusing. But I'm sure I'll figure it out. I'll give 5 stars in the near future ^-^,4

f6fb9c13-015c-4342-8899-d1bbf89f1d7b,"It's a very good app, the only complaint I have is due to no rotation on the screen. I'm using an LG tablet, it has a keyboard connected to it.. Please look into it, I'd appreciate it very much. Thank you",4
586640be-4037-46ee-83ec-fba50de703ba,I simply downloaded the app and since I have ever made a new habit of drinking water easily. Thanks working on breakfast a habit. I am not doing the breakfast thing as easily as water but thanks to there messages and tips it won't be long till that's a habit I do every morning.,4
f3a6922f-bc59-4926-be97-739f3762e22e,This app gives you small goals that are accomplishable. Every week it updates your task in order to keep you on edge.,4

9fcf1337-3c24-4bb5-93f8-d2cc7aeb108d,No doubt that it is a great app. Kudos developers! the only problem I m facing is that alarm doesn't ring at all.,4
f37d48ea-c1bd-4e03-b405-5389df78fa77,"I really like the design of this app (although I agree with some of the male users, it does look pretty feminine. Not sure what about it looks girly, but it does), and it's really easy to use. I love having a little alarm on my phone reminding me to practice my guitar, or maybe work on my French. It's definitely been really helpful for me.",4
50aacde7-7551-495d-8e24-0240380ac41c,I appreciate that this is based on building personal character. The design is very relaxing and meditative. It is very easy to maneuver and allows for the right amount of personalization. I'm stretching to think of anything that could improve it...Perhaps the ability to write a to do list through this program. And my husband considers the design beautiful and relaxing as well.,4
7524d53c-ba47-43d8-9299-167d945fe76a,"Great reminder to get my habits done! Feel a sense of accomplishment when I get a 100% complete day. I truly think I've been sleeping better (my current goal) and I've been enjoying reading more. But I also agree it looks a little feminine. It would be nice to customize the appearance. Also, it would be nice if I could check habits as done for the previous day; once the clock gets past midnight it registers as the next day and there isn't an option to go back, so it looks like I missed a habit or two.",4
96859ceb-02a3-4ced-9c8c-296542170b2a,Helps me remember good habits and get out of bad habits,4
82cc7ee1-386d-4812-ad31-b4b85b8d03ab,"I love this app. My only qualm is that something about the word ritual is very off putting to me, and it is used constantly lol. Other than that , great. I feel more fabulous already",4
8f680806-539c-42cf-bf14-a21d66f5a49b,I admit I was hesitate about an app motivating me at first as this is not my first time downloading an app of this kind. However I found the app easy to navigate & aesthetically easy to look at. Even users without a specific goal in mind will be inspired to make better habits and have the guidance the need to actually make it happen.,4
c47709e4-0cb7-4a17-a837-67a2a34446d1,It helps a lot to keep motivated and gives a clear guidance! It makes it so easy to follow a path for improvement.,4

b85bd5f3-f8e7-48fe-b776-9d975a612ead,"This app is great for so many reasons, but my favorite part is that the exercises, stretching, and yoga routines are built in. My only suggestion is to hunt down some performance issues. On my Note 3 (a high end handset which doesn't have performance issues in other apps) I get frame drops when swiping sideways through the tabbed interface. Maybe too many images are being loaded and causing garbage collection to trigger, or perhaps the app code is running on the UI thread.",4

238e5851-e46d-49e5-adc9-60cca366b963,"Figuratively and literally, this is a very pushy life app. If you miss your mother or need a woman in your life, this will do it. The words, ""dont forget to brush your teeth"" come to mind. On the literal side, it wants to set up multiple notifications each day. Its a good app but after the tutorial i was like, wait but im awesome, i dont need this (and also my life is vibrant and non habit forming which is unhealthy but i like it-but doesnt really work with an app like this)",4
5e619854-bf1d-4b23-b601-c2e50d254149,I was trying to look for an app to keep track of my habits and lifestyle. Does job to keep me on track. I wanted to keep track of my moods too and I found a simple thoughts tracker which could be enhanced with pre or custom defined moods or feelings. Thank you.,4

7d81ed2d-5ddf-4b3d-b932-54e7221334c4,"So I have tried a lot of productivity apps. This figures out what is important to you and gets you on track with it. There is flexibility, but also a lot of built in awesome functionality. Heck yes.",4
d81999fa-5577-4d09-9888-2516396638a9,"I love this. Really keeps me on track with healthy habits. A few things I might suggest is adding something that keeps track of your weight, how much water you drink and maybe even how much sleep you have gotten. I'll rate 5 once the first 2 are put in.

It encourages your progress and since the habits are customisable it was easy to edit them until they suited me, and then to tweak them further as I realised what did & didn't work for me.

e4eafc96-dac1-4aed-b6e6-4284efbbaea6,I really like this app. Keeps me on track for healthy habits I want to develop. My only issue with it is that when you add a habit it thinks that it's day one.

Maybe the developers can make that adjustment soon.,4

Also a more customizable reminder system and flexible times for rituals on different days. I dont want to get up at 6:30 on a Sunday for example.,4

I have a brand new droid maxx, with a 48 hour battery life and I have to charge it twice a day. Maybe when the app changes that feature I will be more incline to use it, but for now I have to uninstall it.",4

But as I am a very visual person I do enjoy the graphics very much. // All fixes made and the developers are very responsive and friendly. Thumbs up, 5* :)",4

9a50169b-3034-4afe-9899-7af6308f5f7a,This is a great app to create habits and inspiration in your life on a daily basis I think it's wonderful and has been very useful for me for the past two days. It only gets four stars because I think that it needs a bit more depth and maturity and when does two things happen it'll be totally worth 5 stars,4

791067db-4eb2-46db-b02d-5d52b1fd5412,This app has so much heart.. It's still glitchy and needs refinement.. But the willingness for the creators to offer themselves to the process of evolving the app is inspiring.,4
