Update, left and came back, as it helps: it's a prop, nudge when I become indecisive and it helps me to resist falling back into negativity - quite a feat! I mainly use the daily routine scheduler features, but occasionally hop onto the community area, and quite often listen to the soothingly motivational messages.",4

415d1d2c-32dd-4ed0-9812-22e742b2b224,Enjoying it for the first week. The idea of building habits by tackling them little by little is very useful.,4
57d8794a-a142-4d43-b032-ae29ca93bee3,It's a good app. Love the colors and visual. When going into mood tracking I thought there would be more. I'm just using the app so I'll update again in about a week.,4

18d765e7-50d1-4104-a742-6c166c9881e9,The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars because it's so much Beals and whistles that I haven't even gotten around to,4

dc86d0c8-0f79-4c90-830c-902815caa3c0,So far I love this app. I've always had a lot of trouble convincing myself to get things done. The only thing I don't like a whole lot is the screen is a little bit over crowded and 13.99 a month is a little steep for me as a college student. I sadly probably wont use this past the free trial due to this. If they had a student plan I probably would tho,4

122b77a8-7ab0-42f7-b50a-eef53e5074b4,"The reason why I rated just 4 stars because the trailer version is only for 7 days, which is not enough to know every single detail about this great app, one more thing I forgot to add which is locked features within the app itself.

da4cdb58-5ffb-411e-8c72-015907ea9611,"I'm glad that I went back to using Fabulous. Now they have many sister apps, and the ads atop my homepage are distracting clutter that I have to swipe to clear. This is despite being a premium member. Otherwise I like the updates since I started years ago.",4

e1c06306-43c7-4012-9a61-559dbd07b85d,"I have a habit of downloading random wellness apps, hoping they'll magically change my life, but they usually disappoint. Most just let me list tasks or habits and send reminders, which only works for a few days before I lose motivation and uninstall them. However, this app is different. It offers real solutions to the challenges you face when building healthy habits. It also helps you connect with your emotions and references real studies and books, which I really appreciate.",4

7dd1f41d-8c02-4091-b72b-3c2495f17825,I love it. Just for the fact that it applies what I learnt in James Clear's book Atomic Habits. The only downside for me is that I'm unable to use MTN momo to pay. I wish that option could be made available. So for that reason 4 stars,4
aedd3ec1-3f95-46be-80a2-a8b338f8179e,A really great app only reason I haven't given it 5 is because I got a bit lax with using it as I had a child and left my job so it was difficult maintaining it. The alerts stopped coming through and I ended up uninstalling it. A few phones later and I wanted to give it another go as I have ADHD and thought it might help maintain focus at work. I'm sure it was free when I first used it and now it isn't :loudly_crying_face: now looking for a free alternative.,4

36ec79c3-35bf-48eb-a47b-55b66c7a845b,I liked its experience but the only thing is that you cannot make your own habits or plan according to your need without paying,4
a95bd670-ec0a-477e-b84b-e918a423e098,"I haven't used it just yet but it looks like a colorful and cheerful encouragement to stay on track. Why am I only able to set up the account with my Google email instead of any of the other email platforms?Also, before even putting in my email, it wants to know immediately how much sleep I get each night. This seems a bit intrusive and limiting. I'm not going to delete the app just yet, but I'm hoping to get a response.You see, I flipped a coin per usual, to decide email.Leopard or Spots change",4

I hope it's a mistake, but it feels crummy that I try to share or save a picture with self care tips, but end up just linking the app. Why would you offer to save the image if it doesn't actually work?",4

Thank you for providing me a free trial though! I do recommend this app to those interested in getting a life coach or wishing to improve their habits.",4

I'm only a week in, but I feel like this app is actually making a difference. They lay out the plan, and I just have to take one emenetly achievable step at a time. Definitely recomend.",4

ac16930d-1209-4d12-b449-4ca7f08643f3,I think over all experience is really good. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is bcoz I'm from India and it's premium version is a bit spending for a jobless student like me. So that's all!,4
22872b76-5a07-4603-b4a8-5e0401b6b410,Only reason not 5 is because the advertising on app store has pictures of different stuff then it actually is but still a great game:red_heart: L,4

It does not force you to do anything and it always asks if you're up for a new challenge. I like the calm vibes it sets forth into me whenever I open it.,4
a2d6e686-7441-4b09-bc62-e6db27afa81d,The fabulous app definitely has potential to do great things but why do we have access to the daily coaching if you have to pay to actually get coaching. I put it on my daily routine list but have recently taken it off because if you don't have premium there almost no point for using the coaching option. as it starts to read you maybe get 1 minute through and it cuts off mid sentence would be nice if there was some form of free coaching.,4
fc02b2f7-b41b-44e4-9e3d-11d4ccf66e4d,Amazing way of building your own routine crafted perfectly to your needs. I'd probably have a bit more content for shift workers as readjusting the routine on the app to fit nights shifts /last shifts can be a bit frustrating but overall amazing app,4

It guides you one small step at a time. Many of us fail in our habit forming because we overload ourselves. There is great science behind this app. As for pricing I see it as an investment.

It starts with the small things that are achievable, but offers many other courses that tackle different personal issues whether they are emotional, mental, or physical. It is a 7 day free trial then a yearly subscription after that but it's a small investment to try to improve yourself imo and I'm sure that there will come a point where I can graduate from having to depend on the app. Self motivation is recommended!",4

9ec86434-b627-428f-ba5a-3c6f00094793,"Overall, this is a very useful app for building or breaking habits. However, it is only helpful if you actually want to change. You are accountable only to you as the app simply requires you to check off that you have completed the task. I am better able to focus on new habits if there is another person going out with me. The discussion groups are great for this, but only if you participate and form connections.",4

Not sure yet if it's worth a paying subscription or if it'll become something I can do with just a to-do notepad and calendar reminders.,4

As a person with ADHD, I tried to add too many goals too fast. The notifications got overwhelming, then I forgot to check things off, so it couldn't show any progress.

For a suggestion maybe wait to tell me about other options till after my challenge is finished. Because I have A.D.H.D bad lol I see new ones that would help so I click it then it tells me.

Two suggestions: ¬∑Multiple subscription options, like monthly, quarterly, etc. Though it is a good deal for an annual, the total upfront cost is not viable for many... especially those who need to fix bad spending habits. ¬∑options at the start for choosing audio or written coaching articles. Possibly different options for reminder tones. Those that really benefit from the guidance, like adhd or autistic individuals, can be really quirky about sounds.",4

It's made me feel accomplished and I've had it for 8 days - decided to subscribe. My only criticism is that the trial should be a little longer so that people get a full experience before having to purchase. Even 2 weeks (which they say is how how long it takes to develop a new habit and stick to it) or a month would suffice.",4

63d259aa-38d1-40cb-aff4-a8b6c3b967fb,I have used many 'wellness' and fitness apps before. This one however stands out greatly amongst its peers. This not only will teach you better ways to eat. It will help you establish the habits you need in your life no matter the schedule you have or the life you are currently living. If you stick this out I can certainly see it changing not only the way you think about yourself but also how you live your day to day life giving you the chance to be your best self.,4

I would like a free month's trial if I am going to advertise how good the app is to my friends.,4

It wasn't until I got through their questionnaire that it even told me it cost anything. At that point I went ahead and signed up for the trial anyway, but it still didn't tell me how much I was going to be billed afterward. I had to hunt down that information. $40.

Some improvements though: - dark mode - I use it at night a lot because that's when I get to unwind - group notifications - by 1pm I have 5 notifications from Fabulous, I wish they were grouped like email notifications so they take less space. Also new messages from Circles, do we really need notifications? I see lots of users replying with ""how do i stop notifications?""",4

It actually wouldn't let me move ahead until I completed certain goals and I like that. I tend to want to get to the good stuff and skip ahead. I then lose interest. There is plenty to do and read here and I'm hoping this app continues to grow with me.,4

I was hesitant to accept because I knew I would be charged if I didn't cancel in time. But it coaxed me into a sense of safety because it said I would be notified before I was charged. I should have set an event in my calendar as well but since the app was highly rated I think I felt pretty safe that I would be notified before I was charged for an annual subscription. Fast forward a week and I still have premium features but no notice... maybe my free membership got extended to a month? It seemed plausible because month long trials also exist in this app. Then I realized my card got charged. I tried to apply for a refund through the app developer and the play store but so far both have denied the request. I did technically get an email from the play store which I found after digging through my email but it got filtered away from sight so I just feel like I was a little bit tricked into subscribing because I was honestly expecting a push notification so that I could then decide if I wanted to buy it or not. So just be careful. Otherwise it's not a bad app.",4

But I forgot to cancel it and as I'd already paid the rest of the month, I gave it a try and I'm glad I did!

The beginning when you pick things you'd like to change could be more user friendly. I ended up just poking around until I found where to add things to my daily routine.

I didn't really have a good overall picture of it all. Nothing major, though, that would keep me from using it! I'm on a really tight budget and was trying it out so I cancelled it for now.

I'm now stuck on a new set of challenges with a much longer timescale which I can't pass unless I tick off each completed item daily. If I miss a day I lose my 'streak' and have to start over.

Plus you can't convince the app to update so my mission is allover the place. Thats a little frustrating as you want to see your achievement to keep you motivated.",4

You have to screenshot everything, including the non pertinent information. I wish the challenges and other timely tasks had an interactive timer.

After the first 3 days (consecutive) of drinking water you can add on a new part of your routine or it will ask if you want to add the new goal eat a great breakfast.

I was already doing a lot of these morning routines but I started them basically all at once about a year or so ago and, although I've been fairly consistent, it is very hard to add so many habits at once.

The only thing that I noticed could be improved was when implementing the goal to unplug and avoid screens before bed, the relaxing audio with bird calls and a stream flowing is very difficult to hear unless you turn your volume to 100%, and when the time is up, the noise of the timer is extremely loud in comparison. It woke me up a few times. Other than that everything is great!",4

The sign-up started off ok but I was hit with a week trial/paywall before I even saw my personalized plan. That was a bummer bc the platform looked good. I still gladly pay $90 ish/yr for Headspace bc I was able to use it in a limited capacity for a bit until I was 100% sold without them pushing the sub on me.

I would like to suggest some changes that have been bothering me about the app. While I like that there are exercise and healthy eating journeys, they should be optional. People with eating disorders may be triggered seeing these everyday, and it's impossible to turn them off. Also, there's no way to change inputs; my screen is cracked and I hit the wrong button",4

aeb4940f-8274-4e3a-96df-60e88bfd136f,I've only been using the app (free version) for about four days but I'm really enjoying it so far. It's helping me stay in routines that help mental health and help me take care of myself and not give into my depression. My one problem is that I accidentally deleted a task from my night routine and can't add it back without paying for the Premium version of the app. I don't like that features that were free literally two days ago are now behind a pay wall for no discernable reason.,4

I like the journeys, where the app suggests positive changes and explains how they are backed by science. I like that better than putting in a bunch of my own To Do's. The journeys take it slow, adding a task every few days. Also I'm not going down an internet rabbit hole deciding what i should be doing every morning or night.",4

Start slow and improve with small increments. If I improve by 1% every day I won't get overwhelmed and can maintain my gains. Little improvements add up.,4

3abf5f03-f24d-49ff-a25e-3012dda62bc5,I just installed this today and I think that this gonna work. Anyway I hope one day there could be a total free version but anyway thanks for helping me,4

However, there is one major flaw. Routines that require a schedule other then daily are forgotten about. For example, you can't track a weekly routine such as call a family member. The app requires you to do this daily, which for some is a bit much. I hope the developers can fix this!",4

d27c9c9a-06b0-4b49-942f-17f4904f54a9,"Back in 2016 I enjoyed this app and it helped me a little bit. I've hit a rough patch and can't even afford much at the moment so I remembered how friendly the Fabulous app was. Sadly, its changed to fit our society where good mental health is equivalent to money. Features that were once free are premium (i.e 3 habits for one alarm if I am remembering correctly you could do a lot more previously, though I could be wrong). There isn't even a list of actual Premium benefits rather a why to buy.",4

It's motivated me to get on with things I would normally put off and has encouraged me to make my routines more purposeful. My only frustration is that I don't take my phone upstairs at night as I have a tablet (and don't like to be distracted by calls and messages). When I downloaded the app onto the second device they don't seem to sync so I have to tick off my routine in the morning instead....,4

5db6ebe3-10cf-4836-9e48-cc3c7c36d5e2,This app is a fantastic good habit builder which is based upon sound science. The app does a great job being transparent about how it operates and why it operates in the way it does.

6cb68504-e5bb-4611-aac5-9b3fbb1e4486,"Great app overall. For sure knowing that the team has brought Dan Ariely onboard adds much respect as well as a sense of authority to the app. You can see a lot of his insights throughout the app. But for my flow Fabulous is overdoing it in some parts and lacks in others. WHAT I LIKED: 1. great number of improvement ideas 2. useful and relevant hints on how to make a habit stick or how to lose one 3. well structured: you create routines and under them you can add specific habits 4. app is flexible and has many features - ""Discover"" tab is nicely done and structured WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: 1. app is ""heavy"". Even if you turn sounds off, every interaction brings up full-screen animations, you have to wait, then go through several other screens that congratulate you. It takes time to go through all that. And if you have several routined or if you postpone something then it only adds up Suggestion: add ""light mode"" that would add just an easy check-boxes list that I can quickly go through. All on one screen. Maybe even without bringing the app up to full screen 2. Interface is overloaded with colors even despite you trying to keep it simple and 'material'. Too many colours and boxes. That is distracting. And I need to focus on the app every time because there are new cards popping up. Suggestion: make the first screen only with what is valuable NOW 3. list of routines and checkboxes. (you can add a small link next to every habit is there is something really useful) 4. Animations and images are creative, but I don't like them much. Also, if this app is meant to represent user's inner self on the path of improvement then it should be possible to make the character to at least resemble you or at least be less obvious that it isn't you (make it not a person). Suggestion: Add some different options for animations/images if you insist on showing them for everyone to be able to relate better Also, I have dropped you my CV, so if you'd like to get in touch - you can reach out. Thanks for the great app. It is addressing an important issue.",4

My only issues are the loud sounds it makes, and that sometimes when I mark something as complete and quickly leave the app, it doesn't register it, and I lose my streak. It should register as soon as you click the checkmark!!",4

I appreciate that they start slow and steady because have a really bad habit of going off in another direction quickly. I'm more unsure of my ability to keep at it then their ability to teach me so slow and steady I hope we'll win the day. I would encourage anyone who wants to change their life to try this app.,4

ee86f079-79a9-4cd0-95f9-bca13bf99f51,Love this so far very motivational and easy to navigate. I like the free fabulous extras like the make me fabulous link for prompts and ideas to help you. Not sure I like the upgrade prompts all the time though they seem unavoidable and a little misleading. I realised I could still use the app without the upgrade to a satisfactory standard and may upgrade later once I am used to the app.,4

d918a01e-a4d2-44b0-ba70-d62060641ea5,Great app with a lot of functionality but a lot is locked behind a pretty expensive pay wall. If the payment was cheaper or a one time charge I would definitely be more inclined to purchase,4

You can't even unlock enough habits to understand if it is useful for you by then. For everyone complaining about the annual charge, I suggest reading what you sign up for. It clearly outlines that you will be charged annually for the subscription after your 7 day trial if not cancelled. Don't blame the app creators because you don't pay attention to detail.",4
c062715b-cf2c-4f13-adc0-d0ebbf07b7e2,"Its a very nice app designed to help people have healthy habits and its easy to use. However if you want to do more things like having it coach you- you got to pay per month. But you dont have to pay for the basics- It tells you to do something and if you achieve it then it tells you to do something else. Example: It starts with drinking water when you wake up for 3 days, then it goes to healthy breakfast for 3 days and so on and so forth but they start to add up.",4

But wait for it - the point in this case is to make the maximum out of it = try what you haven't before, filter out what doesn't work for you and find and integrate new (mental) skillsets that do. The app works for me better than a myriad of online articles cuz it makes me focus in timely fashion and doesn't overwhelm me, and the programs are well thought out.",4

e56d1942-a793-4f09-ba41-a8fd9a864638,"The guys who made this app are evil masterminds. Here's why: 1. They say it costs just a little per week/month, but charge you upfront for the entire year. 2. You need to cancel your subscription by the end of the 6th day, but it isn't clear when the 6th day ends. Is it inclusive of the day you joined? They dont send you a reminder either. 3. Even on the paid plan you need more than 7 days to explore locked sections of the app. So the free trial is essentially just to enter your card details. It doesn't really let you try anything. This way they trick you into buying the whole year. I can recognize a ""dark design"" pattern. I am surprised that this is an ""Editors Choice"" . Perfect example of dark design patterns.

Agree to set prices in app store. Have the website sign up option as well. (think cost/benefit ratio) Be clear about pricing especially with new customers. Increases retention. Everybody wins.,4

ebe90125-84d0-4110-bab1-0b6e8f6c2854,"Great little tool to help one on their new quest to get new habits under the good! The UI is pleasant and all the extra goodies one could expect from a premium application is there, though I'm struggling a lot with completed tasks that keep notifying me that they still need to be completed - even though I (and the UI wuthin the Journey) clearly said it's done. Any input? I sent a support ticket but haven't received a reply yet, even after one week.",4
3a8661d5-6483-48c2-adee-2af79b507b84,"it just works, other apps tells you to do the task you want to do and tells you off if you don't, or even stops notifying you to do it. This app says from the beginning that you are in control, and they are just going to suggest that you do these things and you get rewarded and its refreshing. I enjoy the quotes and inspiration that it gives you after ticking off your tasks",4
e84d559c-d8c1-486a-8c4e-27a62c67778b,never had such an interesting APP. I really love this APP. and I'm an app freak this is truly amazing. I'm really enjoying it an I look forward to the next day I think I will invest to pay for this app an I'm one that is hard to IMPRESS when it comes to APPS AND TECH stuff . but I got to give you :glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star::glowing_star:,4
faab4f0c-14fb-4146-b6b1-20a3e1316e4c,I have been using the app for a little over a week and honestly I had no idea how helpful it would be. I've actually followed the tasks the app requests ans frankly I do feel better. The app starts with really small requests that are easy to complete which makes it easy to stick to and honestly when I wake up I immediately start thinking about how I am going to complete the tasks the app assigned to me. Really a worthwhile app to use if you are stuck in a rut or just struggling to get motivated.,4

I'm having a hard time staying consistent for whatever reason. I love the layout. The selection of videos is limited, but cool. One should really be able to edit the time it takes for habits to be completed. The backgrounds are so simple and basic which is interesting with such a deep concept.

The intention and research behind it are apparent. My only critique so far is the lack of awareness for disability and mental illness. For example, exercises must be adaptive (not everyone can--or should--run, let alone stand) and beginning meditation w/o preparation can be dangerous for someone with PTSD. Major props for religious sensitivity regarding fasting.",4
84a5885e-164f-4e7e-b0ba-df6e4497a698,"this app is very simple, kind, and encouraging. It's very realistic in that it starts very small, and gently eases you up to more ways to take care of yourself. It feels individualized, and because of that, the help it's offering doesn't feel forced; it's not robotic, giving everyone the same thoughtless task. It also explains WHY it suggests what it does and is also flexible, letting you decide when you're ready to take the next step and whether or not you would like to do a certain task.",4

Still have bad days but forming good habits helps fortify me a lot against depression. The habits I chose help keep my space clean and body healthy, so its harder to get caught up in an endless loop of being sad and not being able to get out of bed and being sad because I never do anything. Not saying this app ""cured"" me. But its a wonderful tool in my toolbox.",4
190fa117-23d3-4806-8047-f8d8776a5f72,Dont understand what everyone is complaining about. I have not paid for the app (yet) but find it very useful. Maybe others are just in a rush to build a full morning routine immediately instead of taking it one habit at a time as they suggest.,4

93532660-95e9-4187-88d7-e35d1717bb57,"A great concept that can be very useful for changing habits. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the obnoxious amount of ads and unnecessary ""letters"" that flood the app any time I'm on it. It's enough that I'm considering deleting the app - I have no interest in joining ""The Sphere"" and wish it would stop asking. Aside from that, there are a lot of great ideas that can help you become more put together.",4

It tracks your habits, and uses scientific research as a basis for improvement. I have more energy, more room in my day, and a gentle understanding that true change takes time and effort. I don't want to abandon this app like so many other gimmicky apps that work for a week. The payment was very clear about the amount and when it would charge. It is a year up front, but I think it's worth it for this smart app.",4

cf18f427-d4fb-4b5a-93ad-316df609e787,I really wanted to love fabulous. It sounded great. What put me off from the start is that the app tries you to help promoting it right away by liking their Facebook page and by keep trying to convince you to go premium before exploring the app fully. Overall the app feels a little demanding and pushy. Almost like homework. The notification settings are clunky and I forgot to cancel the subscription before it I had to pay for one year and that was the final straw for me and decided to uninstall.,4

It slowly changes the routines you do to improve well being. not sure what you get for free or if you have to pay to benefit.,4

A few things that would be nice to see: 1-A journal, since so many goals require a journal. 2-Being able to save some of the timers or meditations etc(basically everything in discover that isnt a habit) as favorites, so you can easily find them. I have issues remembering exactly what I want to try in the future, or already tried and liked, so being able to bookmark or favorite it would be great. And 3-A daily to-do list.",4

I also really like the design of the UI it's very vibrant and organized (and super extra points that one of the icons for one of the habits is a pokeball lol).

c8466ddb-64e5-4fbd-8a6e-6e7a2e8cba4d,I really like the potential of the app. Most things are behind a paywall or I would rate it higher. Things slowly are unlocking but it is unclear how useful the app actually is because I have no sense of what all is unlockable in free mode. If most of it stays locked then it's less useful than other apps on the market and deserves a lower rating. This is a service I would consider paying for if more were included. It is relatively new though so it is hard to guage.,4

5a7de98b-5326-43a8-b326-5c8ecfb7d4d2,This is a long term commitment so why advertise as a free app when you only get a week free before having to pay a MONTHLY subscription. So I guess the app works! My well-being is improved already because I didn't waste ¬£¬£¬£ every month.,4

It honestly helped SO MUCH, but my problem with it was that a lot of people with depression like me sometimes, I dunno, forget to eat. And I had anorexia on top of that, so yeah. My point is with a lot of us, we actually need MORE calories, instead of LESS calories, because we really haven't been eating enough. So I feel like it would be seriously awesome if you put a simple little question in the beginning, like, you know, are you trying to A. Lose weight B. Gain weight C.

727f9d9b-4dff-4fe3-aee5-8f5e044024b3,"The first habit was really easy. Just drinking water in the morning. Keeping in mind I had this habit before but I stopped. This got me back into that habit. I think starting with easy habits helps because most if us want to really change right away but it often frustrates us to the point that most quit so its good thing to start easy and lightly. Before this app, I had already started exercising in the morning a long time ago so the first week so far has been relatively easy. I dont know how well it would work with people that have never had these habits in the first place. The breakfast part helped me eat healthier tho. Some features I suggest they should add. They should allow the habit routines to be customized to time and order. For example I drink water first but afterwards I have to feed my cats. And only then do I exercise and afterwards I have breakfast. I cant eat my breakfast and then exercise. It gives me a stomach ache. I wake up at 5 am to drink water and it takes me half an hour to do the chores in my house for a bit. Then I come back to it. It would be nice if it allowed you to adjust the schedule a little more once you've gotten used to it. Another feature would be connecting to exercise apps so that part would be more convenient. I'm also working on bettering my drawing skills. It would be cool if it had profession habits. What habits artists do, how much they practice in order to achieve their results. And what they practice and how. I think that would be an amazing add on to an already good app. They could try that with other professions too that require practical repetition more than studying. Because lets be honest, trying to track someone's studying is tricky. Making them repeat actions to better their skills is easier. Overall, a great app. Its easy to use, good layout and helps you prepare for your habits. That helps a ton. Because often apps just tell you what to do. But this app really tried to make sure you actually do them by making you prepare yourself for them. Like buying ingredients for your breakfast. Putting a glass of water next to your bed the night before. These differences are what sets this app apart from all other apps I've seen so far. I highly recommend it!",4

I was skeptical and unwilling to pay for the subscription at first, but I've totally changed my tune as of this morning, about a week in. I woke up with some energy to face my day for the first time in I don't know how long. If it keeps up, this app is something I'll keep paying for for a while. I'm struggling with my morning routine still, but it allows me the flexibility to not move on to my next challenge until I feel like I've got a good handle on each new habit I add, which is way better for my success.

I missed the daily encouragement and discipline, the mind-set it fosters and the empowerment I feel every time I complete a goal. I note that the developers added a feature to allow me to program my own rituals, which I suggested in my original review, so I have to say thank you so very dearly. Now, I would like to ask for you to connect with Google fit. I find that the more apps I have tracking my information, the more accurate that info is, and the more motivated I am to complete my goals and push myself forward. I suggest Google fit because I'm already comfortable using it, and it actually connects to other apps I use as well - further enhancing my overall experience and the accuracy of my information. I recently began a trial for an app similar to this one, just for the sake of curiosity, and I found that, unequivocally, I prefer the artistry and science behind the Fabulous. My last note is really the only one that matters, though, and it's this: thank you, Fab team and all who had a hand in this, for creating something so personally empowering. *original review* Great behavioral modification app, soothing music and visuals to reinforce new good habits. Only thing to make it better would be to allow you to set specific times for each habit, not just the group of habits Morning Afternoon and Evening.",4

efe6411e-2300-4462-85d0-3df2f2ce891e,"I've been using the free version so far to track and improve my morning routine and try to establish an evening routine. I find it pretty useful, and i like it that i can make my own activities to add to a ritual. I've recommended it to some friends as an unseful tool. But it does use quite a bit of battery. If you turn off the app the alarms won't start, so you have to let it run in the background. I've also noticed that it keeps the screen always on. That's not great for the phone, especially if you add an activity like deep work which takes say 45 mins. You can turn off the screen manually, but there is no setting that allows you to configure the app to turn off the screen after the designated device timeout. It would be better if the screen turned off like for any other app, and then say it would turn on again when the timer for the activity expired or smth like that. Or at least give the user the option to turn that on or off. Also, there are a few glitches like sometimes in the middle of my morning ritual it will go back to another activity i had already completed and i'd have to mark it as done again... All in all it's an useful tool. Idon't know about the subscription though... 15‚Ç¨/month is a lot! Audible is cheaper, and you get an actual book every month, which to me is much better value than some micro coaching exercices you can't even all use (one journey at a time, plus really who has time to do100 rituals a day)...",4

Of course, you can add your own, but I advise waiting until you've established a routine already. It's a little difficult to navigate, but other than that it's perfect.",4

It feels really comfortable and appealing to use this app. It understands that habits need time to get formed, and doesn't make us feel ashamed for missing it on a few days. It very gently helps us realign to the commitments that we make. Also, I really find it nice that they start with small goals which would probably install the appreciation and confidence in us to make and keep a habit. It works on the character, instead of just making us do certain tasks. Kudos to the team for creating a delightful app.",4

cab65d25-bb39-4923-ba70-5077fb505a15,"The whole concept of this app is really great, and the graphics/design definitely do deserve the award. Very engaging and gets you to think about what you're doing. But the research is flawed in some cases (e.g. the entire idea about breakfast has been mostly debunked with recent research. You should not start eating breakfast if you already eat right and usually skip it). It would be cool if the app were continuously updated based on current research. The other problem is that whoever wrote the copy for it clearly had English as a second language. The grammatical errors are minor, but they make it harder for me to take the app seriously and there are some weird sentences a native speaker would never say. Constantly including my name in the copy makes it feel creepy and awkward. The other thing that bothers me is the assumption that your life is a complete mess before you start using the app, which is condescending. I already drink water every morning-- why does automatically start me on that for three days? What if I already don't keep junk food in the house? All this could easily be eliminated with a startup survey so the app is adjusted to your level.",4

I started with basic rituals and will add more later. I gave the app 4stars because the ads are in the way. They are always at the beginning of the list of stuff and I have to scroll through them before I get to my rituals. A design with a stationary ad at the top and bottom of the page would be better.

I like how it builds gradually from drinking water to eating a healthy breakfast, to incorporating a few minutes of exercise. One downside, which may actually be a feature (I haven't decided), is that it kind of throws you into your journey without a lot of explanation. This may actually be a good thing because I am motivated to unlock new content. The app is sometimes not the most intuitive. You have to fill out the exercise and meditation journals before you check off the habit, which I found confusing at first.

Why yes, I care very deeply about successful white men. Morning routine is the only key to success. Sociology is basically astrology, right?... I bet all those dudes drank water for success every morning... Like Michael Jordan's Secret Stuff in Space Jam, it was water all along. 2 minutes into using this and already irritated enough to be having a one way sarcastic conversation with my tablet. Closed it before Amber finished. Thanks but clearly this is not my cup of tea or water. But if it helps you, then that's great. Really. Everyone needs to find things that help motivate them. But it's also important to disregard things that personally demotivate you, which for me is apparently and ironically the self help genre",4

I understand that it takes a lot of time and effort that goes into the making, especially in such a detailed app like this. But maybe if there were different levels of payment?

I had used this app previously, but I tried to speed things along a little by adding one or two additional habits to the routine, before the app itself had advised me to. I crashed and burned because I was trying too much at once. Trust me, one at a time is the way to go! I didn't make it this far the last time. Edit: This app is still doing me good! When I was nearly done with my first journey, I felt that I hadn't really gotten the habits down yet, so I restarted the journey and I'm repeating it. Fabulous is really a fabulous app!",4
ed6c610b-f434-446d-ab8d-313334f2b9c7,"Very helpful, but a little corny. I like the approach of starting one habit and building upon it with subsequent habits. I LOVE THE SNOOZE OPTION for the habits. The reminders and the blurbs explaining why the approach is how it is are cool too. The positive comments are corny sometimes. The WORST was when I got a ""Cerificate of Achievement"" before I actually did anything. It made me feel patronized. Random pop ups that have nothing to do with my set goals are annoying, but don't happen very often. Sometimes it double confirms you will do a habit the next day and that is annoying. I'm an adult, not a preschooler. On the other hand, I wish it had me do my 1st habit more than 2 or 3 days before adding a new one. I would prefer 5 days because I can be inconsistent with new routines. Overall very helpful and an attractive interface. I recommend trying it.",4

The ads for the paid version is VERY in your face if you run the free version though. Have tried to find different apps solely because of it.

I'm doing things I don't normally do and it keeps the things I'm suppose to do together instead of jumbled in my head. Nice work guys.",4

Over the last year l have tried to reach them using what little contact info I could find but they dont contact me. Even tried googling the Center for Advanced Hindsight (or whatever their cutesy name is) without luck. I have questions but can't get answers. I know I could get more out of the program but cannot figure out how and can't get any help. Have only been using the program for four days, but it is already very helpful in keeping me organized and helping me remember important things that I otherwise forget like eating and taking medication and celebrating my life.

The only big problem I'd have with it would be that during the challenges I can't skip one of I already had the habit. For example I've had to wait 3 days to finish the drinking water challenges when I've already been doing that since forever so it adds nothing to my morning routine. I've added some new habits next to it for the morning routine just to make myself obey a ritual. I love the coaching sections, even though all the exercise sections are way too intense for someone who's just started or who has illnesses. Still,great app and plenty to do without the paid subscription.",4
f55a571a-f001-4163-bd2b-e9b7094dcfb4,As someone with ADHD and bipolar this app really did help make the daunting task of routine establishment managible and even easy. I thought it was silly at first just drinking water but it was worth sticking it out because once I got the water thing nailed it was easy to add other stuff onto that habit. I also like how it let's you snooze the routine without negative consequences. It's a very encouraging app. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I would prefer a one off payment option instead of a subscription.,4

Cons: super pushy into getting you to buy the membership. It is a good price however id be fine having banner ads simular to how the app Duolingo works. I dont like how an actual alarm noise is for paying users only, thats very picky. I would like to see a period tracker and video tutorials in the workout sections. It would be nice if you could see how your friends are doing, kinda like how the app Lifesum works. Pros: I love how its vegan and gluten free friendly with the meals. I like how it doesnt calorie count and just simply has focus on the food benifits. I like how it sets realistic goals and not expect you to do everything. Its motivating, simple, and easy.",4

The hardest part about any healthy decision for me is making it a habit. It's easy to do it for a day or two but what about a whole two weeks? Three weeks? That's hard. So hopefully the app will help me stick with my healthy choices. It does give me a good bit of spam for Sphere. It's not annoying adds or anything. It's subtle, but id rather not have it in my face everytime I complete an action. I simply can't afford it. I'd like it to be an option in the menu or something so you can get the pop up once or twice and if you decide you want it you can go to the menu and click and pay and all that good stuff.",4

It will come up repeatedly as a notification on your phone. You'll get motivational 'letters' on the app which halfway through reveal themselves to be another ad.

BUT the gentle reminders(when they work, I had vitamin reminders for 2 days then just randomly stopped) instead of annoying phone alarms and suggestions are very helpful, would think about subscribing in the future as imagine it being very useful if like myself you go through long periods of healthy habits and then something throws you off and little by little you forget to do things until your depression has kicked back in and you've missed your vitamins for 3 days etc",4

I have been using it for my wake-up routine and it's had such a positive impact on my mood throughout the day. I would definitely consider upgrading to the paid version so I can set up some more routines throughout the day (one for lunchtime chores and another for bed time preparation). The only tip for improvement that I can think of is an easier way to set and edit alarms. I have accidentally women myself up at 6.45am before!,4

It hardly takes any time to set up and edit, and from there you can just let it run. It focuses on the benefits of forming habits and routines, but it doesn't force you to do things it's way. It will remind you to do tasks at certain times, but if you'd rather do them later, you have a checklist where you can check them off at any time. I would advise you to start by forming a few important habits, and form a morning routine first. Follow the app's suggestions, start small and work your way up to the point where you really have formed habits and routines that are second nature to you.

I love how well it inspires a person to develop healthy physical, emotional and mental habits; which also inspires discipline in general. The visual design is also easy to navigate and charming to look at. Great app!! The one issue I have is that when Fabulous opens up on screen as a page or as an alert icon, it will interrupt my display screen. So if I click on another app icon to open, I cannot open up my app. I have to either open Fabulous or close it in order to open any of my other apps. Or if Fabulous opens while my screen is on sleep, I cannot open the screen by tapping on it like usual. I could not power down my tablet, so I had to hit reset button to turn it off and power it back on. When it came back on, the time and date were wrong and I had to change it. Please fix this.

cfe311bb-6340-4161-b444-6d154e6dfa23,Great app. Just wish it would allow you to undo stuff. It tells me it can't un-check a completed task because it wants you to relish my victory. That's stupid. I can't relish a victory i didn't actually complete because i accidentally tapped it as complete when i didn't mean to. Over all user friendliness isn't high for this app either.,4

I had this app before, but mentally I hadn't prepared myself for real change, but what I did like, is that the app's reminders were PERSISTENT! It continued to remind me even if I did nothing and it would make me feel a little guilty. I joined sphere recently (their premium service), but so far it is helping with a bit more motivation. My only downside is that it can repeat tasks a few times in a day if it didn't quite register it, but in all fairness if that is a reminder to drink more water, then that isn't necessarily a bad thing.",4

I might have to try the full version to get more personal tasks.",4
b8c4243d-c18e-4265-bea1-18042ec03c92,"Very colorful, clean motivation app that helps you build good habits nearly effortlessly. The app starts with small daily goals and your successes quickly snowball into larger and more impressive wins. It provides lots of value for just a few minutes of attention each day. For example, eating a healthy breakfast everyday was a struggle for me. Healthy means ""work"" and the last thing I want to do in the morning is cook and clean dishes. I ended up skipping breakfast most of the time, telling myself I wasn't ""in the mood"" to eat that morning. Or, on the rare occasion I actually felt hungry after waking up, I'd tell myself I ""don't have enough time"" to cook/clean. Instead, I'd buy sugary carbs on the way to work, which often led to a sleepy, sluggish afternoon. This app started me out with a deceptively easy task: drink water every morning for 3 days. It took me over a week to build up to my first 3 day streak. But, the digital confetti and encouraging words felt great to see. It's easy to forget to celebrate these little wins when you're focused on the end goal. Since then, I've progressed to eating a protein-rich breakfast everday and I'm working on building a new habit for light cardio in the morning. Exercise is not an everyday habit just yet, but this app gives me confidence that I'll get there one day soon.",4

The reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, as I feel it deserves overall, is the fear of loss (fol) tactics that litter the app disguised as well meaning next steps. I understand the need for revenue, and considering the quality of this app, this is not a deal breaker, but I find the psychological tricks used to clinch sales to be in like taste. That said, the points of sale are also non-intrusive. The total lack of apps is appreciated, and saves data. I Am a fan of this development team and may someday wosh to donate or purchase their services, as they are rooted in good, well meaning psychology ~ I'm on day 7 so far, this app is an elaborate way to force you into healthy mental habits. I'm very happy with it so far, no invasive adds or junk mail. Drinking water and making breakfast in the morning may seem obvious but it's something that gets left by the wayside in my generation. It's easy to forego the benefits of such simple actions, But the evidence is there for why these are great ways to start your day.

It's got a bit of a 'game' feel, with chapters, titles like ""An Unexpected Journey"", as well as simple but nice audio and graphics. Their approach mirrors that of my psychologist, which means no conflict in trying to establish routines, etc... and they have thought this one out with respect to ensuring your environment is changing to help you succeed (ie. If a main challenge is to have a healthy breakfast, there's a preliminary challenge to buy the necessary ingredients, etc... plus other options for different diets and lifestyles, and tips to ensure success). I've only been using it for a few days and, although it seems occasionally glitchy, it's not impacting its usefulness (eg. it's given me credit for a couple of challenges I haven't met yet, but I'll take the wins where I can get them! :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:) I did sign up for Sphere straight away, which might have been premature, as my little timeline started getting very busy very quickly, but I'm happy to have Fabulous as part of Operation: Claire Gets Her S@#t Together :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",4

904027a5-f69d-4fe6-a856-17ffa8db183a,Simple and elegant - supporting you with kind words and a gentle push to do the things you already want to do and know you should be doing. After using it for a week I've noticed my energy levels increase in the mornings and a want to do more productive activities. A useful tool for people who feel stuck in a negative routine and want to feel more acomplished in controlling their own actions - not through impulse but through mindful decision making.,4
14af4330-a374-4c91-8ac0-ee500033cff3,It's a visually beautiful app. I trial appreciate the built-in intelligence. Articles that pop up that apply to you. It got 4 stars because of the super short trial and the fact that you don't get a list of possible 1st habit options other than the water thing. I'd like perhaps America's top 5 habit goals as options.,4

However, I don't like how it's been designed for you to not be able to uncheck something once it's been checked. Sometimes I end up checking the wrong item and I'm not ready to complete the task, so that's very frustrating. I either have to hurry up and do it or I keep it in my memory for awhile to get back to it and then I forget. But because it's checked off, it of course approves it as if I have already done it when I have not. They should reconsider this.",4

Would also be very helpful to have a ""Why?"" come up when you skip a part or all of your routine. Illness, surgery, injury, etc...

At first I thought that I should be able to make all these lifestyle changes under my own steam (which I have been doing & partly succeeding), but it's astonishing how motivating it is. It is like a buddy I am accountable to. It helps me that the daily routines are called rituals as it is a positive word that suggests to me I'm doing myself s.th. good - which in fact I am! Have only used it for 3 days , so still struggling to find some of the functions & trying to adapt it to my needs.

Sometimes I don't check the app for a few days even though I'm doing the tasks because my phone is flooded with notifications- which is fault that lies with Android, not the developers of this app- however, it would be great if you could add completed habits after the fact.",4

It is fun, if a little elementary, and is an upbeat factor as I go to reordering my days. The interface took a few beats for me to suss an approach that made the app useful for me. This may be a generational thing, I'm not of the smartphone set, hate scrolling and I'm all about elegant minimalism in interface design. That said, this app does have a neat layout, restful to the eye a and the conventions used are probably more familiar to smartphone users. Also, the sounds are soothing, a nice touch in the morning for ingraining commitment to the routine I put together for myself-mainly, putting a lot of good, self-serving needs for myself ahead of launching into taking care of others.

fbf131cc-cc93-4790-8120-1f1fe9160ea0,Amazing potential. I am currently on the 7 day trial considering the upgrade. The one-size-fits-all approach is an issue as there is a selective application of research that formulate their journeys. The inability to customise a journey limits the apps potential. The biggest issue is that their challenges are not updated by the tick box in the daily ritual. Pretty serious flaw after requesting you sign a commitment certificate! Otherwise the app is very attractive with great potential. Will be powerful in future if they can understand customisation does not dilute behavioural change. The free app is a good way to assess the paid version.,4

Now that I am paying for the app I do not feel much improvement from the free version. I think it needs a better menu cause it I'd difficult to figure out where is everything and something does not make sense like it tells me to exercise 3 days of the week o my 1st week of sphere but my alarm ask me to exercise daily or the ritual is not complete. Also I think I needs more explanation on the exercises as the picture does not helps you to know how to make them.,4

aad62a08-f413-4fe2-90ff-437c458b1248,"It's a very usefull app for those who want changes in their life. Habits are really important as they improve your will power. I'm on the first journey therefore I can't be totally ovjective on the overall app so my rating is subject to change. They not only tell you what to do but why to do it. The fact to subscribe could hold back some of you but consider that you invest in youself not only in the app. By committing to it you're more likely to achieve what should be hard otherwise. It's like going to the gym guys, not for your body only, but for all aspects of your life. I think it deserves the price.",4

17d3788e-a4ce-4df2-a6fb-d04d7d9fb520,"It has helped me to get going with habits. I have ADHD so I tend to get stuck doing things for too long or get stuck between things and this really helps. It also does a great job motivating better behavioural changes like making lists and prioritising. I'll leave it at 5 stars and I'll come back if that changes! ----Edit 2 month later---- I have been using this for quite a while now and I gotta say it has changed my life. Even when I sometimes go down in a dysfunctional spiral and stop using it. It has helped me realise that it's not me I should blame, but my environment. The way to correct my behaviour is by making so the environment around me allow for those changes. It might seem like I'm trying to rid my self of the responsibility. But its the contrary, im finally letting myself see what the problem is and there for, I'm able to do something about it. I'm not lazy, I just prioritise wrong. Now I can seek out the real limiting factor and adjust it to make life work again, instead of blaming myself until I can't take it and just stop caring out of fear of failing again. I'm not dysfunctional anymore, im pretty fabulous (Sorry for the cheesyness) Also I started paying. I usually never pay for apps but this one is worth my money.",4

d6b55f21-3e8d-4356-8647-c4518b3a1fe1,"A tool for creating habits using several habit formation techniques. The primary method is employing a technique of developing tiny habits, such as drinking water, as an anchoring habit. Through this anchor, it adds somewhat more difficult habits to this anchor which tends to be more successful at creating new habits. There are a variety of helpful messages that motivate the individual or guides the individual to make the habit formation process more painless. I appreciate their focus on starting the day/ending the day off right before the journey continues to transform other aspects of life. One gripe I have is that there are no descriptions for the exercises and other ""Make Me Fabulous"" activities which is quite frustrating.",4

I am just completing the ""start an exercise habit"" journey (doing the final ""exercise 22 days in a row"" challenge) and am now running 5 km EVERY morning, including BEFORE work, and getting there on time! Can't wait to start the ""fabulous night"" journey, as I am terrible sleeper and struggle to get to bed early. Get this app, it's awesome! I never, never, ever pay for apps, but I signed up to the premium version in Jan 2017, sphere, mostly because this app is exactly what I need to motivate me, and its way better and cheaper than a therapist, and I want to ensure the developers are going to maintain this app. It's just that important to me! I did get a discount price of AUD5.99 per month for signing up by a particular date tho. JAN 2017: Really liking this app conceptually, although it's a bit buggy. I have been stressed at work for a long time and now feel burned out and I am now really struggling with motivation at work and at home, to have a good diet, around the house and to exercise, even to get out of bed in time to get my kids to school and me to work on time. This app immediately changed by morning routine with just simple things. I am hopeful that it's going to really help me get out of this slump as it keeps adding to my daily ritual. Probably too early to tell tho.",4

However the only complaint I have so far is that the way they talk about food and meal planning is basically for a vegan diet, as if it's the right and only way to shop or eat your meals. Although I'm a guilty meat eater, I'm not about to eat tofu but I still want to lose weight and be healthy etc. They could be more diverse with this, maybe have an option to chose your dietary preference?",4

So far it is working. Drinking water 1st thing in the AM, eating a healthy breakfast, eating a serving of vegetables or fruit for lunch, making fish or nuts a staple a few times per week, etc. All habits I have made or am working towards making habits of already. But here is the thing...it is gradual. I tend tp want to take on everything right away. And if you want to, you can. But this app encourages one at a time and wont add more until you are doing well with the previous habit. I am trusting the process as it was made for me and it is working. I already feel better and each little triumph builds my confidence to go on to another challenge! I really am loving this app!

If I change a ritual like remove a task from the list then the previous days work done on that particular task disappears.

I would like if the timers show me how much extra time it took me complete the task after my time is up and again I don't want to change the time I required before.,4

My one complaint is that sometimes the app doesn't register that you've completed a task, and you'll have to tell it several times that you did what it asked.

70a234aa-9e21-4784-9ae5-4168213ed65b,Nice application. Visually well put together and the principles behind it are good. Beyond the initial setup (which is great for people starting out) it gets a little unclear how to continue using and developing it (it's not quite the app you can use to develop lots of habits - more like 2 or 3 key ones). In that respect it's currently better for newbies who don't know where to start on lifestyle changes rather than folks who know what to do and just want a nice environ in which to record it.,4

But on some or other device when it is installed there is no option to create or sync profile.. So it is device dependent..

So at the end of the week/ month/year it can give you a progress report on how well you are doing or let you know you need to try harder. But have the snooze and skip botton still available.,4

It's not just a calendar / reminder app with inspirational quotes. I do find it a little pushy but that's too be expected in an app that helps you develop habits. I've only started using it but it's pretty neat so far.",4

Also, I get the rituals concept, but I found it tedious to set up different rituals just to customize when my habits are scheduled. For example, if I do something on Saturdays only, I would need to create a Saturday Ritual. It would be way easier if I can set the days for each habit as well",4

Only three suggestions though, it might be better to sort all of the already-selected rituals first, so that they're not mixed with non-selected rituals. Being able to edit the allocated time whilst adding a new ritual would be nice. Also, don't default to another screen after selecting each ritual (stay in selection mode until finished selecting all of the rituals).",4

Right now I'm having trouble with the ""great breakfast"" and the excercise parts out of 3 habits (the one I am really doing everyday is the glass of water), but even so, I say this app is great, because having trouble means that I am at least trying to do it (and sometimes successfully) instead of simply not doing it at all.

It would help to be able to keep a list of habits to add as I think of them but am not yet ready to add to a ritual. Some healthy competition would be good, too. Maybe start a community with rankings and kudos. I love the approach and the prompting is effective for me. I don't care for the choice of music.",4

2db87124-e9e3-4887-b48a-a4ae5a0d8838,Could be a really good app if it wasn't waking me up all hours to finish my ritual that I'd already completed. The solution would be to make the rituals more flexible so you can skip an resume much easier without penalty. As a parent this is essential. Also a more customizable reminder system and flexible times for rituals on different days. I dont want to get up at 6:30 on a Sunday for example.,4
