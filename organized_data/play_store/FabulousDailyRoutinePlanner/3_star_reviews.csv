Simple to use and idiot friendly (I appreciate). Pretty etc etc. But I get a feeling that less (or more for the free user) could be more.

The main downside for me is that its just too busy. I open the app and feel like i've just entered a busy motorway. Its confusing to navigate, and there are too many images and options and tabs and notifications and icons and sound effects and just general clutter. I never know 'where i am' in the app, and i'm a heavy user of technology so its not me being untechnological. I used it for the first two weeks and really enjoyed my small steps of progress but eventually I found I couldn't gel with the confusing interface and endless options and invading visual stimulation. I really feel that there is just no need for a 'community' and for strangers to send eachother little motivational illustrations (?!). You would have to be on this app for hours every day to benefit from all it's available options. This app is just trying to be too many things at once.

It seems a little shady because a first it looked like it would be completely free. It didn't say there would be any in app purchases when I downloaded it. I also don't like that the trial goal was just for you to drink water in the morning.

One thing that the app really needs is building one's own challenges and continuing with the already done challenges. Eg- the water challenge is complete after being done for 3 days. There should be options to continue it for more time. There should also be a timetable Option to include all this stuff and more and a day plan maker would be a cherry on the cake.

Hope that more qualities will be added to the app; feels kind of small but I have a sense that it could be a powerful tool and I want it to succeed: Like the use of psychology put into practice; the use of personalization though I assume the app is a ways from becoming that essential. Does it offer habits on diet and exercise? How about spiritual practices? Subjects on socializing? Sorry if wordy, just fascinated.",3

I want to be able to push done in a notification and get on with my day, just like I do with my ""take your pills"" reminder that I set up with Google calendar. A basic notification tone, then I get to it when I'm ready - not some alarm followed by some crazy animation when I check a box and noises I don't wanna hear at 5am, then being told why I'm doing it. Go away! Bah!",3

It's not a bad App but there are some shady ways they do things. Be forewarned. I used this App years ago and loved it. Went to do the week free trail(back when I used the app before it was free). In the app they make it seem like a small purchase. When I realized it was $50 up front I cancelled my subscription(within an hour of downloading so it SHOULD have been in the week trail time). I go into PayPal today a week later to find out I was charged(I checked because my car was declined buying groceries). Come to find out I was charged. I'm beyond angry and filed a dispute with PayPal. I'm hoping it will be resolved but probably won't get back the $30 overdraft fee from the bank.,3

I see the value in that but having to click snooze or just check it off later is demotivational. - Very opinionated in what you need to get started. doesn't allow each user to start at their own level, very linear in progression All in all, this app showed me what I needed to be fabulous.

Not everyone has the free time to enter in every step throughout the day, but you are sure reminded plenty to keep track. Secondly I have a gripe with the premium subscription. When you are new and offered a 50% yearly discount there's also ads for 60% so I am confused as which one is true.

But I keep getting sooo many notifications on my phone during the day, to check something new out or remember to do something. It's really annoying and just irritating. This app has great potential, if it wasn't for all the notifications. Also please fix, that if I don't place a glass of water by the bed before I go to sleep, that I'm not following my tasks as I should. I just go to the sink the first thing In the morning and take a glass of water. And no need to remind me several times a day with notifications.",3

16adc6e3-dcab-432c-8b3a-72b8e9029b83,"* * * The Fabulous App, while colorful, did not feel very well laid out. Instead of ""encouragement"" up front (which I could apparently not dismiss), it would have been more useful to make the first items my goals or projects. I was constantly having to scroll all the way down the display to check off accomplishments. * * * The app seemed to cater specifically to people with a rigidly fixed schedule. I would love to have a fixed schedule, but in my field this does not usually happen. In my current position, I could be working any shift. The app did not make it clear or easy enough to set the different alarms. Further, there seemed to be very little consideration for shift workers. The app was constantly going on about doing things in the same order at the same time of day. It would have been nice to recognize the segment of your user base that does not have a ""9 to 5"". * * * When the task alarms would activate, I never knew quite what to do. That is, if I was having breakfast, do I leave the app open the entire time I'm eating and just listen to the ambient music? That seems like a purposeful battery drain. * * * Oh yeah, also NO DESKTOP SUPPORT.",3

Also, if you backlog something from a week ago, you can't undo it? I understand the current day is to get you to commit to your habit but this is a separate design flaw. The workouts it wants is distracting as it wants smaller ones when I've always done a high intensity one. I guess if you're an athlete this isn't the app for you. For the general public who may need habit training this is great. I did have a premium membership and I was able to see I had too many habits and not enough time to myself which I adjusted after reading some books on micro habits and using the word no to set personal boundaries.

While I wish I could use and enjoy this app, it's just too cumbersome to have to stop what you're doing to deal with the reminders. I wish they would just minimize individually to some place in the app to deal with when you're not right in the middle of something else. Either swiping away or snoozing each task individually has become just too much of a nuisance to be useful. I want to just go back into the app when I'm done with whatever and check them off. They also REALLY spam their premium version inside of the app a little too much. It's hard to learn how to navigate it when every other option is just there to try to upsell you. I wish them luck and hope they change this app and improve it over time. **Original** This is a great concept. It works very hard to try to convince you to pay for more, but isn't limiting your ability to use the free version successfully. It's a handy set of reminders to do things - that's all.

I guess I thought that once you completed one journey it would move on to establishing an afternoon and evening ritual at least. It'd be really helpful if you made it clear what stuff is free and what isn't. Maybe list the Sphere options and the regular options separately in the description. Thank you :),3

I know it became an editors choice app but can you at least let us pick a habit we want to work on and not make us pick something we don't need? Not trying to sound harsh I'm not. Just a tad bit frustrated you have to different tasks for 2+ weeks for a couple months just to unlock the feature you want to use. I never had any problems when the app was free. I'm not saying the app is bad. It's really good even helped me alittle. Just wish people don't get so greedy with these kinds of apps.

It was unclear to me when I started, but this is the ONLY journey that is included. It doesn't matter if there is a symbol next to it or not. I thought that the subscription service that they were pushing from the beginning was a separate service from Fabulous, but in reality, it IS Fabulous. So now I am faced with a decision: Pay $5 forever in order to continue to make incremental changes the Fabulous way (which has been working), or try to keep going on my own, using the features available to me now (which is unlikely to work as well). To a certain extent, I wish I hadn't started. If anyone from Fabulous is listening, I would much prefer that the journeys be in app purchases than having this be a subscription service. I hate being tied to subscriptions, period. In addition, there are journeys that I simply don't want/need, and according to other reviews it looks as if they need to be done in Fabulous's order. I would be happy to pay considerably more than $5 to unlock just the journeys I need and free myself of a subscription. Hopefully this review will clarify things for other people. If I had read a review like this, I wouldn't have installed Fabulous to begin with.",3

I had it downloaded but had to re-download it because while it let's you reset your journey it didn't allow me to reset my data. I wanted to start with a fresh slate. However when I re-downloaded it, the app became very glitchy and not user friendly. For example the reordering section of the habits doesn't work. It will move things it's not supposed to, and won't move stuff where you put it. It will show you duplicates and all sorts of other things. The other version I had was way better. Also I wish that I could edit the times of the recommended Habits because sometimes they are to long or to short for what I need. You should also be able to add the same habit more than once in a ritual. For example I am not just drinking water once, so I find it more helpful to have reminders during that routine. Finally the routines should be first. I don't like that I have to scroll through your ads for the premium version and the alarms and such to get to them.
