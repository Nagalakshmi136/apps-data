e08e61e2-0b3d-4e15-86f1-ebfb45a9279e,"Great way to share good and bad habits that you need to be held accountable with friends. However, this app is a little bare/boring. I would also add a feature where it reminds you that you didn't check off something on your day. I wish it would also give you some suggestions on habits that you might need help improving on.",3

b51521d2-329f-4f75-a81c-5c3905778734,Nothing too fancy; a straightforward habit tracking app that makes it easy to hold your friends (and yourself) accountable. Reminders are optional too. I wish it had an option for a dark background,3
2b46d35a-c063-4304-9392-d3e345953bd9,"Your app has a lot of potential but lacks some key UI capabilities that will enable easy engagement. You can't reply to a specific message when you give feedback to your ""shared"" friends. The feature to send a Gif or Sticker is just appalling. One can't add their own sticker extensions that are compatible with the app, gifs are sent as a link, and to send a 'habit commitment' through the use of a picture can only be done if you click on the 'sticker' option.",3
7f3990ef-14f8-46b7-ab2f-3c16542d957f,It serves the purpose but in a very limited (1 on 1 only) way. The inability to have a group view and chat function given the accountability focus of this app is likely to mean we won't continue with it long term. Group chat at a mjnimum would be a significant improvement.,3
73044a6f-d9bc-4ad7-a564-56c1ec91edbc,wish it had a dark mode but otherwise good :thumbs_up::thumbs_up:,3
6b769da1-0c1d-4124-8d96-65b87f84cf21,Needs group setting. You can share individually with friends and message the person but if you want to use with 3 or 4 ppl each one is separate. You can't make an accountability group which would make this a superior app. Right now it's just ok.,3
e8432340-23df-4bf7-94c6-f5883ea1e8c2,"This app is soooo close to being useful... I'm hoping to use this with a group of friends to help us all keep accountable for working out. However, since there's no group chat option and also no way to share pictures or gifs to show what we're doing or to congratulate others, it's not quite perfect. I'd love to be able to instill some positive reinforcement as a group instead of just one on one. Really connect to our community nature to change habits (peer pressure in a good way).",3
a6de9c76-ad64-4998-9b8d-21c4ac8a5289,"Tasks are fairly easy to set up. Missing option for every other day, biweekly, which changes week to week / month to month. Dark mode would be nice. A high five/in app reward system that lets you know your friends have seen and acknowledge or support your progress on task as feedback and endorphin boost would be a good next feature.",3
ff7b4e8e-d69c-44c5-8ef3-a9c0992c70e9,EXXEPTIONAL Please add the feature where you can be able to see and compare between the all habits. Percentage wise,3
de87dba3-2818-43fe-a34e-3d9ae8ab1d45,"POSITIVES: Simple. Clean. There's one habit I ""share"" with a friend: We see each other's workouts, and in the context, being able to message here is more appropriate than texting. NEGATIVES: I just started using it again after a year. There's been no development / updates. Seems no maintenance (responses to reviews stopped. Note, I haven't reached out to dev.) No problems so far with the app. But it LOST ITS WIDGETS, which I'm not happy about. (Android 12, LG Velvet)",3
e0ba86e3-0641-449b-9146-1e1e7c5ab7b5,"It would be great if you added more statistics, like longest streak and total days of doing a habit. Like that we will have 1- Current streak, 2- Longest streak, and 3- Total days. You can also add specified habits. For example: If you want to develop a habit of drinking water, the habit can be how many cups did you drink to day?, instead of did you drink alot of water to day? Thank you",3

2ba4cbb1-ea8b-4891-87f0-668c062972d6,"Neat little utility app, non distracting, minimalist and does the job. Its missing dark theme, gets boring looking at the same theme everyday for a long time",3

ac373105-ca5b-4c62-b4d7-e3230a780fbe,"I would like more flexibility in how many times you can track. Example, if you brush your teeth 3 times a day, there is no option for this, the number is just 7.",3
ffcb033d-288e-452a-aa1a-681cf1de1cc5,"Good idea on theory, needs tweaks. There's a glitch on the friends page - under my friend of says ""no habits"", but when I click on their name it shows they so indeed have habits; there's no widget; and I wish there was a communal page where my friend and I could share the same habits and see each other's input on one page, or see our different habits on one page to make the accountability feature better",3
d04386b5-e94e-4e30-bf72-22855345f795,Good app for tracking habits. The problem I have is it just wipes off my check-in records. It's frustrating because I have to check-in all over for days I already did. Please fix it.,3
c1b2fd17-82c4-4736-9fed-e9cc944afcf7,Not as functional as you'd think. You can share habits but you can't see the ones shared with you on your main page. It requires work to see the habits that you are doing with others. Isn't really conducive to starting habits together because of that.,3
4626718b-bc3d-4d02-8cdd-8f59425a8310,Online sync need to be improved. I don't get the latest status in my second device.,3
44fa42d4-f816-41a0-a7fd-94b9c45a2a65,I like the app but...I wish you could add more conditional buttons on the days input; like a 1-5 scale or which exercise you did on that day...etc.,3
8dfec953-bb29-4efa-ba43-65518ad992eb,"It was working fine. But twice it deleted my entries of last two weeks. Otherwise, this app is awesome. I have recommended it to my friends but now I'm going to uninstall as it's not reliable. Although, I'm using it since 2 year's.",3
b57a5aa7-d16d-4b5b-a48d-155c37406990,"Thats what I wanted, if we have more color shades than red and green that it would be better if task is done with half percentage.",3
afcfaa6d-73af-42ab-9a1e-d081bbe4fb84,I can't scroll back to older messages and I miss message notifications cos I use this to chat with some accountability Partners now. It will be great if these things can be looked into..,3

0b1faea6-0e12-4294-80a7-51c481830f1a,Instead of the info. In % can we also have the option to check the total number of green & red days. Also please make it so we can see the total monthly or early data by zooming in or out,3
2bd92b0e-eff0-4418-bd59-560642d82f9d,"EDIT: Okay, now that the bugs have been fixed, this app is EXACTLY what I've been looking for! The reminders help me establish my habits and the accountability of having friends on there with me gives me motivation. ORIGINAL: Really want to be able to use it, but... without reminders, it feels kind of pointless. I really wanted to be able to use this to establish new habits and accountability with friends, but until the reminder notifications are fixed, this app is, sadly, essentially useless",3

85eec1f5-f9c6-4285-b9e1-72e55a98fef0,"This app has great features including sharing and documenting habits effortlessly. However, it's biggest shortcoming is that notifications for habits simply do not work consistently. Both my wife and I have the same problem. Contacting the developers at their email has not resulted in any response. All other notifications work fine for both of our phones. Fixing this problem would make this app a 5/5.",3
bdd1f9d0-278f-42dd-9a46-29ad29301dc0,The app allowa me to share the habits I want to get rid of so I get more pressure to get it done. It's perfect to not charge money! But but but! It indeed lacks some interactions and competitions with friends! It will be even better if we are allowed to have comments down below others' work!!! Just like supporting each other.,3
a824faf2-c113-400c-8fbe-65f9916692e5,"Received a spam SMS within an hour of installing this, first I've received in years, coincidental? Otherwise it's good, but very basic. Stats would be nice.",3

If they could resolve this issue, would definitely use this app again! Otherwise 5 stars. The option to use different colours for different habits would be cool too.",3
96a1ba4e-10ad-48b1-b15d-6e1026c56955,It works great at the beginning but then slowly stops saving the things you put in,3
1116f5cc-ef0a-4970-9c7a-e531a8c5172d,"Love its simplicity, option to describe & comment (I don't like the ""fail"" option thus 3 stars). I'll be able to track my struggles & try come up with an action plan. Nice we can add an accountability buddy. I really appreciate this app. Suggestions: (1) be able to search for accountability buddies via this app; some don't have anyone in their lives (2) have the ""fail"" changed to maybe ""setback"", it's not good for someone who's mentally unwell & trying their best to constantly be clicking ""fail""",3
