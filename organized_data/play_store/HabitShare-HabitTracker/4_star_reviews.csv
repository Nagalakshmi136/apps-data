69917556-eb1f-4928-9c5e-7bd032f494d6,"The application is very good, our tracking record is improving.. just a feedback, if it improves a little it would be good for everyone. When we tick Habbit, the time-date mentions when we have updated Habbit.",4
617a3109-9636-4831-b9c0-b90d3b594545,"This is a great app for tracking and sharing habits. Sometimes the marked habits become unmarked after a few seconds, that's the only issue. And I've been using it since 2 years, now it's a bit slow and sluggish. Perhaps the development team never thought someone using it for so long with so many daily habits",4
65305139-7be6-4b2d-af4d-dfd037aafe38,"So far, this is my favorite app to track my habits. I'm not giving it five stars because every once in awhile it gets glitchy and my data disappears. I've been tracking everyday since the year started. It's 2024. I did an entry today and everything's gone",4
d447e434-0fa7-4efa-926e-afd9e370c391,"It’s the best simple app for sharing habit/task accountability with friends. Love the customisation options and that I can sync across phone and tablet. Would give 5 stars if it had dark mode, landscape mode, and widgets!",4
b0ecd67b-b185-4f56-bfab-27ac64ed32bd,"Great app, we need copy option for complete notes we take in, for example if I add notes for 10 days, we can see the 10 day notes line by line but now there is no copy option.",4

To continue normally, the app then needs a restart. A friend of mine is facing the same. It's quite annoying. Could this please be looked into Or is a fix already on its way? Other than that, great app, highly recommend it",4

17865b42-7e4b-4e15-94e9-c8aeced52f8c,"This app is very good when it comes to tracking habits and sharing them with an accountability partner. I couldn't find anything good that's as good as this one for sharing your progress with another person. That being said the UI has a ton of scope for improvement. It would be nice to have a dark mode. Although I like the simplicity of the app, if it could look a bit more modern it would be very nice and well worthy of a 5 stars review for my use case.",4
ae2fef02-d469-4f6d-a0d4-7fba2f7219af,So far so good. I like that I can make notes in each task to keep track of quantities. I wish I could color code the tasks and maybe have a twice or 3 times a day check marks for some tasks.,4
fa00d55f-7fca-41a3-b997-10cef26da5db,I love the simplicity and its accountability feature is very good :thumbs_up: However your chatbox needs to be fixed because I mostly experience few seconds delay after sending a text. And also add a feature for group accountability.,4
a0d072a1-330e-4790-b031-789474021eee,"Really happy to have found an app I can share with my life coach to stay on track. The app definitely functions as advertised, and my only recommendation would be to add a to-do list function for the 1-off tasks that don't need to formed into regular habits. That's just a personal preference, and other than that the app works great!",4
c6eaca99-52b5-4e4e-8ec8-914964a491ee,"Really like how easy this is, to use and not intrusive. I get reminders and get to keep up with my friends but it's not overload central. Please make a widget!!!",4
b0fc5d4a-2815-4d85-904b-57fadda94bf6,"add features so that my friend's habits can be seen directly on the main menu, so that we can see my friend's progress immediately, and for our habits to be used together, as if ""my friends and I are in one group, and we can compete with each other in completing progress us, it would be great if it could be developed",4
2b00fabe-728e-41b7-b52f-a2b1fef57287,"Really brilliant app and a lesson in good UI/UX - simple and intuitive and feature-slim. One bug that sucks: there is a horrendous delay when typing into the chat box, seconds pass between tapping a letter in the keyboard and it appearing; it's unusable. I speculate this may be due to a quirk with the latest Android version? Pixel 7pro on very fast wifi.",4
b10b6794-da10-4893-aee4-33324c589c4a,"Could use some more features but still a really nice, simple (and add-free!) way to stay on track with my habits and keep motivation up",4

b771b38a-0654-4b7c-9f98-519ccd3ef11f,"if it's just had a dark theme it would absolutely get 5 starts, but generally i like this app and it's very helpful.",4
f41bbb73-b641-4542-9bee-e5dbb3d16a23,"So far my experience has been great, I love the different features of the apps especially the friends section, give you an accountability partner One thing I would love to see however, is the addition of the reminder time under the name of the habit in the main page I have to go 3 different screens just to see what time I set the reminder and it gets tedious when you have 10+ habits",4
34125edf-e305-46f5-b219-bdce0ac90fbc,"This is a great app but can be improved by adding a 'bulk' update feature via highlighting or dragging. A heat map and alternate views would be nice too, but overall pretty good.",4

0ddfcb81-6e18-46ff-80c5-07b48ed89012,"Great, minimal, sleek UI. Almost perfect. Needs group chat and team habits that individuals can check off to solidify the social sharing aspect. Would pay a couple bucks just for a widget.",4
ac4157df-6c06-43aa-bb81-385b2466bb9f,"Can we have a time limit for habits, let's say a 30 day challenge, where you can put a start date and a end date, thank you",4
8628cb8e-72ea-4eb4-a976-a000a477914e,"A bit boring but very helpful. I feel like the idea was great, they just need to make it more fun. Maybe even add a screen widget so we can mark our progress from the homescreen",4

68eaa599-02d5-4551-b719-c5964f878fa4,"Perfect! Free with no ads, simple design and quite snappy even on my old tablet. Only issue is that sometimes my daily ticks don't seem to stick so I have to check them after I close the app, but all good besides that. Thanks heaps!",4
294b6a08-f2a4-41b8-bc6c-90f949147753,"Great app. Does exactly what it should. Gave it 4 stars because it's a bit all-or-nothing. If you don't do the habit, the label is ""fail."" It would be nice to replace ""fail"" with a less loaded term. Instead of a binary success/fail, it would be nice to have a ""didn't do it"" option and a good-better-best. That would make it less all or nothing, which would help with motivation over the long term.",4

0d942224-e295-4df9-b3d3-c60e5e97b6e3,"From 5 to 4 stars: sometimes when you use it offline, the text you place in the check marks gets deleted once you go back online. Without any way of retrieving it.",4

57b106a5-afaa-47d8-84cc-ef8c11876d47,Great for progress tracking! 4.5\5 stars because Wish I could download it onto my laptop :laptop: too; but works very well on my cellphone :mobile_phone: and tablet.,4

55b606d1-cc35-4366-a8a4-15a2b992084b,"I like the simplicity of the app and the fact that you can share with friends. Also love the reminders and how we can set multiple for the same habit. I recommend it. As a suggestion I would love to be able to categorize or group (maybe a colour coding) the habits. When there are many habits you have to go through the whole list to locate stuff. Perhaps if categories are not possible, you could group them or add colour by frequency so that is easy to work with the list. Thanks.",4

aa56df52-1f7d-441f-b23d-f4f60e0040e9,"Great app, only feature I would like is a ""bad habit"" type. Basically would just be a counter that would auto count until you said that you screwed up.",4
0b9bc181-abeb-4aa8-9ecc-af3be710e09f,"Great idea and product. Would like to see option for weekly overview; also want to suggest option of sharing within the community, I.e. being able to add friends who have similar habit goals.",4

e339b95e-6956-4c5a-a656-b55d6bf2e4fa,"(Editing from years back) I love the simplicity! Possible add ons: one-touch marking for filling in the days; a locking mechanism---some habits may be personal. Needs a yearly view (anything for faster scrolling), and additional stats such as ""best streak, [date range]"" and ""habit's start date"" would be lovely. I love this app, but despise how it's missing these features. Please add them in!! Reordering can be buggy at times. I believe this backs up all your data, too. Is that right?",4
431a0664-898d-4b25-a153-12ba17ad1728,"I recently download the app, and invite my friend. So far this is a good app, it runs smoothly and without lag. I do hope the developer will add more features like photo attachment and notes.",4

4cabbbfb-738a-4041-87a0-92d82436c608,Like the app so far. Clean design. Easy to use. Task list looks fresh. Love that I can share goals with friends.. BUT reminders don't work. Happy to revise my review once you guys have this bug fixed. Nice job overall! Keep up the good work!,4
0b686dbb-bab2-4d10-9295-358a2f260e6c,"The app is amazing so far, there are a few issues I've encountered mainly notification problems this includes not receiving notifications from messeges, reminders and check-in. Overall, the concept of the app is great. Hope these issues get fixed soon.",4
3a5949a1-6e1b-42aa-8679-b8862779e042,Very good concept. More features wouldn't hurt.,4

19d67894-4a81-4511-a45c-98ca774a273c,I only gave it five stars since I could not give more. Brilliant in its simplicity and functionality. I could not ask for more (well.maybe there are a few minor additions I would like to be added but anyway! Not that important),4
af191a3f-3d92-4ed7-beb6-b1a563b995b4,Very very good app personaly so useful to me but one thaught in every time runing in my mind why not any feture about backup...if backup feture add in this app so more than useful to compere runing time...

9156d626-5f44-452f-af9d-17b46e8a5304,"Very good! There aren't many options for habit building apps that you can share with others. I wish there were graphs and percentages added to this app. I love the ""comment"" function.",4

4216030d-e68d-467e-bc28-9e116b66c98c,"It's good for setting new goals, you show calender and your action in your smart phone. Also you can share it with your friends to persuade them do the same.",4
cbf638f6-03a5-46e3-a216-75c4d970d731,"I've been using the app for two weeks now and I'm loving it so far.

06c2d12f-b28b-431c-8957-46d13cc6ce6d,"I've been checking and using habit trackers but this app was the unique to cover 2 key points in my opinion: tracking for analysis and social sharing for accountability. Besides, it is available on Android and IOS, which helps a lot regarding social sharing. I really like the app and see great future. For the development team, there are three main features that I missed and would help the users a lot: 1. shared habit 2. possibly to change habit color 3. filter of habits Keep the great work!",4
57e8b026-4b33-4860-be7b-c16d6705e704,Good. Kindly Add 2 options ; 1. Color for priority wise tasks. 2. Overall report (graph) of all tasks simultaneously.,4

e12a2f11-211e-4768-a1c9-d56cb3945595,A great way to maintain accountability with friends. Not just for exercise but for things like drinking alcohol or meat or other life things you want to keep track of.,4

89ee0c24-811d-44d0-b4dc-6b6bfa7308b3,"Does allow you to track number of days per week, but does not allow you to limit behaviors (for example, five cigarettes a day, two desserts a week). No widget. Requires an account before you can play around with the interface. I like the social aspect for accountability, but wish there was a way to see the interface before signing up. Otherwise, works as you'd expect, very seamless, easy to monitor most goals. (Edited to increase stars after 1 month of use)",4
81b05ea7-2637-43ed-a76c-9a685cc1986f,Nice! Helps create as many and track daily with graphs. can you get one graph for monthly stats of all habits - a summary or overview let's say?,4

6a5e8af1-47ed-446e-bb31-0f5f1da8fa65,Very good design for the purpose. Though im left wanting due to my several devices not syncing automatically and not even a simple button to do so. Do I really have to sign out and then log in to a device for it to sync? A simple sync button will do if autosync is a bit more difficult to do. Thanks again for this great app.,4

8c0393a0-6bdc-4a9d-afa3-6c9b8589b938,Very good but please introduce widgets!,4
b542e5ac-09e8-45a9-9ca1-2a1077db11bd,"I love this app a lot because of the accountability piece! It's so easy to use and even has an integrated messaging system. I love that you can make comments on each day so if you're tracking something numerical, you can just put it there. I knocked off one star because I'm having issues with the notifications. I turned them on, but do not get messages or notifications about my buddy checking in to her app. I made sure I checked all the right boxes... But the only notifications I get is the one reminder that I set for myself.",4

26483b06-1de0-488c-b32a-d3ce81369e57,It works great for the most part. My only problems are that currently I cannot use my own profile picture and the design could be cleaner.,4
6f02fc35-b36f-4ea6-9b61-e06b908f86b6,Great app. If only the notifications worked...,4
394ace0d-e363-4f7b-b8d1-8e0c4cf19dfa,"Love it, but is there a way to reorder the habits. I saw another comment about dragging/dropping but I don't find that option ?",4
6548c2db-3a64-4fc4-8c91-6753a70090b7,"Useful, sleek, flexible. Favorite feature is the ability to look back at records. Great flexibility on which days you want to assign for particular habit.",4
4b508726-b939-4e6e-9b55-845dd8d799f5,It is an amazing app i' m in love with it .. i just wish there is an option where i can Start Over all the habits at once .. it is still a great app,4
76e5ec6f-f9e0-4fb2-9256-ccbccbada1c1,"Great tracking app that aids cementing old habits! Also liked that friends can share and thus support you on the journey. Wish there was more graphics to show your progress over time, or compare more than one habit(s) progress, but it's generally not bad.",4
fdf71e41-253a-4b4e-9383-d02a9a8649cd,"Great concept and clean interface. Very helpful, thanks! Biggest critique is that reordering the habits seems to be buggy and it doesn't drag properly. Also no option to do something once a month which is a fairly common frequency (paying bills, meeting people, etc). Not being able to change profile pic is another minor issue.",4
491ac679-3bda-47dc-b337-2f4c0e32099f,"I'm unable to change my profile pic which is frustrating, but other than that, the app is straightforward and I like that I can have this accountability with friends.",4
94e2395c-77a6-4d71-b14f-5ac6c59f0cc8,"Love the app! Very useful, especially for making habits together with a friend. Only problem is the notifications don't work. Would be perfect if that can be fixed !:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",4

12c2a479-5516-4967-ac95-ae69581e3b7d,Simple interface that helps me keeping track of successes when trying to learn a new hobbit. It's a shame thou it doesn't work for my wife's phone that is on Android 4.3.,4
64fb3caf-62eb-46ed-b4b7-46a27e6e06d0,"As a habit app, convenience is very important. I would appreciate if this app had widgets to make logging in habits easier to track.",4
e753b974-79a4-40dd-a757-b5d5b2a2f44a,"This app is clean, easy to use and efficient. The coup de grâce to my search for an app like this, would be a widget. Apps like this NEED a widget to constantly show the checklists and allow ticking them off in order to avoid the trudging behavior of opening an app to see what's up next. Would throw that 5th star, and a couple bucks in, for a widget!",4
8dd06683-4d82-4bd3-9906-002533cba93f,"Simple concept, but executed well. If you ever need an app for you and your friends to keep each other in check when it comes to starting (or keeping up) with a habit, this is it! Shared it with my friends and they love it too!",4
