ee987ef5-f327-43d0-ba93-80fe4ebf5114,"Not syncing data properly among friends - me and my partner use this for his ADHD to give a challenge incentive. His account is stuck at 13% completed no matter how much we add or take away, which of course, isn't how the app works. Not sure what this glitch is we've done everything bar delete accounts. Annoying",2

347ab296-e864-4405-a752-41dd059ac82c,This app is designed specifically for shareability and falls short in the UI and other areas. You can share habits so others can see them but not so they can join them or add their own to their account?? Why not just have a copy habit button??,2
bf067a35-326e-4dee-96bd-bed161ed10f7,Dark mode where????,2
588dad0d-2a5c-428f-ad19-69daa62894f6,"Meh. Almost halfway useful. Needs to be a little more intuitive, for starters. One serious lack is that it doesn't display the frequency or schedule for a habit. I cannot see that at all for habits friends shared with me. How am I supposed to know how often? I have to go into edit mode to even see what I set on my own habits. That's an unacceptable omission for a habit tracker, IMO. The inability to put any images in chat is very frustrating. I will be looking for something better.",2
06cf1799-175b-4f09-b11a-45c18fa56b6a,The app shows incorrectly on the screen. It cuts off words and makes it hard to use,2
c0f995eb-f4cd-4caa-9ca1-9575c0681c87,"Go to sign up, you get 3 fields to complete, name, email, password. You fill them in and press the sign up button and get a window pop up ""Oops something when wrong signing you in"" the only option is to press ""ok"" (which is totally not ok) then it takes you back to the start. Sorry but an app you can't sign into is not much use. I've tried all the options but you just go round in circles.",2

eb9b81f2-9dec-40a3-bcc0-4d02ef85375c,"I need help right now, my habitshare app has been freezing and closing and not saving my comments activities. Not sure what is causing this, but it is very frustrating.",2

2281ae1f-aa87-44dd-b2b5-2420db3d5d0f,Promising app but missing basic functionality. 1. Monthly reminders don't work as expected. A monthly task was completed last month on the 29th. It's the 16th and I've already had 2 reminders. Don't remind until 29th. 2. Collaboration on a task is not possible. Each month my friend or I should check the smoke detector. This doesn't work in this app as we each have to have our own version of the task. Allow us to update a single shared task.,2
a742bc0b-752a-4187-a42b-bd602a42bd6b,"Sadly, your algorythm can't do basic maths (2+2 is 4 minus 1 thats 3 Quick maths) and track my progress tchproperly. I will continue using it cuz there seems to have no other app that allow me to watch and keep track of my ""pre-demande"" friend who sadly, is losing brain cell every year due to the condition. Bref, please fix your app, it need some clean up and if it doesn't do a good job, my friend will hate it and will stop using it. Thanks !",2
b23cb7de-a67b-4fee-baeb-fb9ac26c9817,"I like the ease of making habits but I don't get the notifications. I turned on the reminders, turned on notifications through the app, and turned it on through my phones settings. I'm still not getting notifications of the reminders. Without that, this app is useless. I assume its a bug because I had this app a few years ago and I had no issues. Is there anyway you can fix this?",2
05eabf0b-0bd3-4cf1-9282-55379157d0a9,Good concept.. But as I was having a lot of things to complete in each day and even after marking it (in respective task columns) at the end of the day .. The data of the previous days got erased.. Worst ever feelin ..As I finally got a good app without any premium and this problem is driving me crazy... The only way we feel happy is when we see some progress in our betterment.. So pleased fix this issue as soon as possible..,2

d3f7e214-a582-4968-858e-5903342d3bce,Its pointless if they notification is just in the status bar. I need an alarm to push me to do it.,2
b03b9d66-5d8a-41df-865c-21b06566ade4,"Percentages and streaks are often inaccurate. Unlike the simplicity and personalization of the app, but it's no good if the math doesn't work.",2
d4e85b4c-e7e7-4915-a89f-520d4ab2e304,"Notifications/reminders don't work. Maybe there's a certain permission that makes it work, but most of the permissions requested seem really unnecessary and invasive.",2

656de47d-4875-4d29-a027-231313f0df28,"I took off two stars simply because of a t e r r i f y i n g instance that the app mixed up notifications. I have one down for self harm that I share with my boyfriend and when I marked it as a pass it notified him as a fail. It hasn't happened before now and I doubt it will happen again, but it should possibly be looked into. Aside from that, great app, good connections, simple and easy to use.",2
e3ceef2a-0c0c-4745-af7e-a98ff91f7a73,Lack of a graphic or chart. Not many options like rate the yes/no habbit. (Went to the gym but didn't put as much effort. Run but only a mile) The only up side is the collaboration feature,2
8ed9e7a5-c630-47d5-b0dc-b3acfd6030db,"Basic, which mostly works. The big annoyance is ordering. The touchscreen based drag and drop doesn't work at all. It's extremely frustrating. Given that so many have complained just give us a more basic interface where you can input an ordinal integer. Uninstalling.",2
1cc60be8-3230-4332-9f52-05e841349b1a,Love the idea of this app but the features don't work. The messaging feature alerts you that have a message but then doesn't display it. The my habits screen will not let you open the habit to confirm you've completed it. Only thing I was able to do was add habit details and share with a friend.,2
07684cf3-a39e-4576-8fff-d494128d0869,"A lot of little glitches, can't adjust profile picture, can't change default picture (screen goes black), the week is not a standard layout...seems like a rushed app without much thought put into it",2
