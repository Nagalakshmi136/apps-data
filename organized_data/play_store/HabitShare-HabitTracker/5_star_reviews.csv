I have found better apps in terms of user interface but the chatting and sharing facility is the uniqueness of this one. Also, Zero ads! Grateful for that one!

fb3416b2-c581-4d82-b558-60d74f6b8728,I've been looking for something like this for awhile. A friend and I make deals with each other to stay on track with doing things that we know are ultimately good for us but are hard to stay motivated to do on a daily basis. This app supports our efforts perfectly and it's hugely helpful that it's available for both IPhone and Android systems. Kudos to the developer(s)! Nicely done!,5

One of the books I read told if we share a goal, there is a 76% success rate verses about a 36% success rate going it alone.... This app takes advantage of accountability without a call... I also noticed seeing my friends hitting their goals is making it easier to hit my goals.",5

I love how you can share with friends to help you maintain that extra accountability. Most importantly, the app works well. It is very smooth, user intuitive, and bug free, which plagues so many apps out there. A must download!",5
