Firstly, this is essentially Google calendars with a pretty art style. That would be just fine if it weren't for the second issue. It asks the user to subscribe to make more than two habits. They also ask you to rate and upgrade before you've had a chance to use the app. If you want Google calendars with a pretty coat of paint, go for it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",3

0fdb219f-93f6-4bed-87cc-d5177693c1fd,Tbh it let me put two goals on my calendar then it kept showing it's 50% offer for it's premium. Like let me see more of what you can do first.,3
935e144f-ab9c-473b-af83-a5387b943be2,Seems like a great idea for an app but you have to pay for it and you can only add to things to the list if you don't pay,3
e1b41d45-4cc2-4036-88da-707dbb850f4b,"I can't delete a task or edit one once it is added. The preloaded examples seem fairly random, I made my own from scratch. It has potential but it's not great how it is.",3
20658b4e-5f5f-4c1f-848b-f21eb6661f81,"Cool concept but I couldn't figure out some pretty basic functions like weekly or monthly view of tasks (could only view today's tasks) & this made it difficult to organize.. also could not figure out how to edit tasks that were already added. Seems like this app should still be in beta, it needs a lot of refinement.",3
9329b5ba-1f30-46a5-9880-7f10f4f9a881,"Feel like I paid a decent amount for little options or personalization. Great for someone with money, but I can't remember to brush their teeth.",3

5e9d1c14-81b5-4687-84c3-09373f292fe7,"I used this on my iPhone and loved it. It's lacking on Android though. I hope they get this version up to where the iPhone one is because I did really love this app over there. I've been able to halfway make this work but it has been difficult. Please reach out to me as I would love to suggest ways to make this better, features that would be helpful. I know the developers can get this app where it needs to be, it's just taking some time it looks like.",3

297e8d50-ad1a-46aa-b600-ff0cc058225e,I don't understand how to navigate the app. Would love to understand it. But the only YouTube tutorial I found was of a different version of the app. I have Google...,3
234530a5-8fe5-48ef-8965-3d00e231d16d,it's ok! I don't like paying though,3
891eb563-244d-4789-b5dc-5fb3705578fe,"ok..,so I read some comments about tasks being preselected and you can't customize them which you can. It pushes the option of preselected ones onto you but if you keep typing and the selection isnt there it gives the option to add your own, I was even able to add a emoji to it. Yes i did pay for it and I was annoyed because i wanted to do a free trial but trust me its worth the money ,my suggestion is to try the trial first and if you actually need it then pay for it.",3
b3b06abc-d308-4ddc-9997-0afb8c97b88f,This looked amazing and could really help me get on track. But one problem I have to pay for it. Some people don't have the money for it and we just want to get our lives on track. To me it isn't really fair.,3
60e74bfb-1391-4eda-b1d2-4656d87113eb,You can't click out of anything that pop ups. It just wants you to purchase something. It pulls you in by asking questions but you need to get premium in order to have full access to anything or you'll be stuck in a repeat cycle of clicking x to get nowhere.,3

8bab87c2-0f82-49ca-87cc-18903324751a,It was going good until I start scheduling and it kept want to do stuff I didn't want to do and it wouldn't let me schedule unless I did it,3
abf51359-181a-4e1c-a1e0-c0bf8969757f,This could've been really useful if it was free. If teens wanted to use this to help them get better and have their life easier. I think it should be for free due to the fact that not everyone has money to pay an app so it could happen.,3

125257b2-b9df-4dc9-bebe-91a5aaf9ed7c,it does give you a free option if you close out of all the payment options. wanted to give it test run. will update once used a few days.,3
8a2aeddf-ec49-4103-822d-eac8a24fbdce,ME+ Is a good app if you want a schedule and something to help with anxiety but you might have to pay for a subscription after a while of having the app.,3
