It has a nice way of making a to-do list and a routine, it's very easy to use, it has a cute & simple ui, and it can remind you of your tasks. But, personally, I really don't like the constant pop-ups of the subscription and random reminders. I feel like maybe put an option for those who aren't interested in the yearly subscription?.. And can there be a way to personalize it? Like, having a dark mode, etc. Overall, I still recommend to download this app.",4

Second one - make easier planning, for example I need to add 48h intermediate fasting on first 2 Thursdays of the month and 72h fasting on the 3d Thursday of the month.

0bc991e6-ea63-4567-909d-5ebb990b3e7f,I really enjoy how this app works but one major con for me is that the notification reminders are silent and there does not appear to be a way to make an audible alarm type reminder which makes it incredibly easy to forget or bypass if busy or the phone isn't already in my face. One of my biggest mental illness side effects is executive disfunction and some memory issues so I feel I could make much more use of it if this feature was included and would likely subscribe longer because of that.,4

I have used a lot of these apps and this one is particulary appealling.I shall update later. At the moment I have not upgraded but actually it looks as if it may be worthwhile.

This app is rly calming and I haven't felt this way w/ other apps.

At the moment there are only pre added headings and most of them i dont use and cant edit so i have search for the next task to complet on all tab. Also setting it up so when you tick off a task it moves down to bottom with remaining to do at the top. This is a wonderful app but needs more content and minor adjusments to make it so much better,4

This was helpful to keep me on task. It's full of life with the mellow colours unlike many clock apps where there is no choice of colour. I wish it was free, but it would be worth it to pay because you can tell how much effort was put in the app.",4
33c12c36-8b9c-4ae1-9aa0-42b7bb256b78,"I loved this app before the update. The tasks you perform multiple times a day no longer have the option to tick off one at a time. So if you do something 3, 4, 5, etc. times a day, you need to remember how many times yourself, which is difficult. Also, the completed tasks used to go to the bottom so you could see what still needs to be done from the top of the list. That's much easier than scrolling through to see what still needs to be done. Please change these back, and I'd give 5 stars!",4

If i wanted to drink 8 cups of water a day, there was a pie chart that would fill up with every added cup, so even if i forgot i could look to my chart and see that i had already filled it up to 6 cups and had 2 more cups to drink. i did this with my food and brushing and everything. now it's just the same as every other app for me",4

e7d3c8c9-1cc6-4f78-8e5c-468040c324db,I love the simplicity of this app. I've been using it to create my daily routines. My only complaint which I'm hoping can be fixed by the developers is I wish I could re-order the subtasks within each task. It seems the only way to do that is to delete all the subtasks and re-write each one. Would be nice to just be able to drag and drop them like I can in the normal tasks. Also would be awesome if there was a widget to add to my home screen. Thanks Me+!,4

There's no monthly view, it goes by week. And if you added a task for tomorrow or next week, there is no way to edit it. Nice app but misses the mark.",4

One tip for people is I create my own tasks when I want to do something multiple times a day. For instance I need to massage my eyes twice a day for my dry eyes. So I created ""Morning eye care"" and ""Night time eye care"". The checking it off is part of what works. So if an update could make it so if I need to drink 8 glasses of water I check off each glass, that would be an improvement. Thanks!",4

5d14fa87-afc4-4793-9677-339bfa72c30b,"Seems like a great app but you can NOT create an account, so there is no way of keeping your ""account"" on a new device. Otherwise I'd give it 5*.",4

e95d57a5-0341-4048-94a4-550a59d4eb6c,Really nice user interface and options. Whether or not I have the ability and motivation to stick to it is not a reflection of the app,4
00332177-ec03-43e7-9980-96c54843b15c,"So far, I love it. Got a couple of bugs. If you are trying to create a tag for yourself, click the checklist box to pull up the keyboard, then click add new tag. For creating a name of task, it won't let you use space bar so type it in and add space when it's all typed out. Hope that helps. And also can just name a task then add a check box inside it to be simpler.",4
69a3c2fd-4174-4b0c-87e5-bc5c9b9784cc,it's pretty nice,4
1e376681-d9e2-4a7f-bd7b-865f40fc8a31,This app has helped me a ton. However I wish when I organized my tasks it stayed in order and didn't shuffle around. Overall satisfied with this habit tracking app!,4

9e9f996f-1f66-4b89-bb30-d38bb75b48df,Great app. but it would be quite nice to separate the medicine timings as well. if I want to assign Medicine task 3 times a day. I don't know how to do it.,4

I first opened the app while phone was closed and then opened it where it stays small so I can see the questions. Bingo! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:",4
42cf4bf6-5de2-4dd7-928b-fef1fe9e56c2,I feel as if the app understands me on a personal level. Not a one option only kind of plan!,4
1e6414ce-5a1f-45b8-aab5-37bf1e6afcf2,"I've been searching for an app that has a journal, Habit Tracker, and 2-Do list all in one to help get my life in order. I really like the user interface for this app. I actually almost bought the first year subscription for $20. Before I did, I looked around again and found a comparable app called HabitNow for a flat fee of $5 for life. I recommend Me+ if you see a $20/year benefit. IMO, that is a little steep for a Daily Planner app, but like I said... ""I almost bought it."".",4

I have not gotten any pop up ads to subscribe, however I am not able to add custom tasks. :slightly_frowning_face:. I am able to go through the whole process of creating a custom task and get a confirmation, but it never shows up :frowning_face: If that could be fixed I would purchase this app in a heartbeat.",4
