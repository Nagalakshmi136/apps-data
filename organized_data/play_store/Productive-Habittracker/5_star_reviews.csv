You can create your own habits or use the suggestions. It's great as you can color code them AND categorize them into daily slots (morning, afternoon, evening, anytime), + choose if it's a Daily, Weekly or Monthly goal. You can add reminders and even create a One-Time Task. LOVING IT <3 I also use PinkBird and Daylio to track my mood/more personal stuff. All 3 make the perfect combo for me :folded_hands:",5

It makes you focus on the habits and keeps them in mind. The routines work with your mind and don't replace it. The in-app suggestions are great as well. I would like to see widgets for the homescreen though, and maybe a reduction in price, since $6.99 is too much. $1.99 is preferable. Will buy ASAP. Definately deserves Editor's Choice! Will make 5 star later",5
