The only problem I am having is with the notifications. Whenever I set a notification for a habit it never actually notifies me. The notification section doesn't work. Something that would be useful is if you could set a reminder in a habit but for a specific day. For example, if you want to set a reminder time for 6 PM on Monday, then you can only add it for 6 PM, not Monday.",4

2e48f144-fb78-4f7e-8e93-d882463006bc,I like the way it works and all the functionalities it has. It is simple and very intuitive. The only problem I had after using the trial version and now the premium version is the customer service. They take ages to respond to simple questions. Something that just came to mind is that they do not have an android widget either.,4

Functionality closet to what you have with Outlook or Google Calendar would be really helpful for different habit/task tracking. For example, remembering to get the trash out every Tuesday. You can do weekly, of course, but it clusters up days it doesn't need to.",4

b5eeab71-56b7-49fc-8f56-927b4205a330,"It would be nice if the timer in the app wasn't only set to minutes. It would be nice to have hours as well. Because it doesn't make sense, the timer can go up to 600mins, which is 8 hours when you can just have 8 hours. But otherwise, the app is great, just that tiny adjustment, and this fits my needs for a habit tracker app.",4

72e82477-3bbe-48af-a611-b4619a2204ad,"Nice app. I love the UI. But this app spoils the motivation by asking to get a subscription for more than 3-4 habits. Also, it has a lot of ""get a subscription"" pop-ups, which are very annoying. Otherwise, a good app.",4

554b5f67-3ed8-4097-b887-111f0dbc7991,"I really have enjoyed this app. Straight forward enough for me to actually use it everyday. If I could make a few suggestions to the devs: - if I have completed my weekly quota for a task, I don't want the task to disappear the rest of the week. It would be nice to be able to swipe additional times. (Ex. If I wanted to go to the gym twice but went three times, I want to show that) - if I forget to swipe the tasks on the correct day and want to go back I can't swipe some. Great app",4

I would give it 5 stars if there were some more consistent updates like new weekly challenges and other implementations to keep things motivating and fresh. But all in all.

deddbda7-d44e-4d16-a5e7-818793c94917,"I really like this ap. However, unless sive done something wrong, it doesn't give you reminders (even when you set them up) about your challenges or tasks and you have to open the app to see them - this isn't very good if you're not great at keeping a habit or are forgetful. Additionally, if you don't open the app for a day it assumes you missed the challenge for that day, as opposed to asking if you did the challenge or not.",4

I couldn't find a backup and restore button, neither I found it mention in the ad for subscription (all the ad show was a countdown and X% off, no detail what premium offers).

cee91fb5-b1f1-494e-a142-f38c6c47ead7,Great app. Limitations locked behind a pay wall were kinda bogus. I understand you need to make money somehow but limiting tasks doesn't encourage a user to be diverse in their list of to-dos. I was only able to do 2 or 3 tasks daily and nothing more. For a busy person 2-3 tasks is very small. I'd of even been ok if you made money from forcing me to watch ads instead. Or to make customizing stuff locked behind a pay wall. But limiting tasks was a flaw. (Personal opinion),4

7d5721cd-3bde-44d8-ba4a-117acde391f6,Amazing app with a really appealing UI. But the subscription fee is abit too high for a simple habit tracking app that there are hundreds of free alternatives for. If it was a one time fee or even a free version with ads. I would seriously consider it.,4
cd5f8dd8-aac9-48d0-a3c3-19f560ee3de5,It's a nice app to make nice habits ..... It's helped me to make my new healthy habits which I wanted to do from a long time...!!!,4

I only have one complaint and that is the price. It's way over priced. If this was a one-off purchase of £5 I would buy it in a heartbeat. As it stands, the value is not there and I will not be subscribing.",4

Especially when putting school into the mix. -subroutines! Yeah, I need to moisturize, but that's part of a bigger morning hygiene routine! Lists within lists if you want (advanced mode?)",4

The first gripe is that from the layout and spacing of everything, it's not very compact. I feel like this is more of a fun view than a ""managing"" view. Making things slightly more compact can go a long way to helping actually manage the day, and be more productive. My last gripe is not being able to sync premium subscription with my iPad.",4

As a woman, all the cleaning tasks I have to remember are so overwhelming... more overwhelming than the cleaning itself. But this app is like an external hard drive freeing up space in my mind to make it have an extremely powerful performance.
