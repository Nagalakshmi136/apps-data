1fd783ca-11d9-4df7-9649-05c211a8141d,"Been using it for a few minutes and here is my feedback: What i liked about it: (1) Good app design and animations What i REALLY dislike about it: (1) Greeted with an invite to be a subscriber the moment i launch the application (2) Extremely overpriced for what it offers (3) The application seems to be designed more as habit tracker than a ""Habit tracker & To-Do list"" - there should be a dedicated tab for To-Dos.",2
ed2de835-dd79-4903-9374-5e1572edcc33,you can't try the app without putting in your card details. the fact that they need my card for my 7-day free trial makes me really not want to try it. i would risk it if the prices weren't so sky high. even spotify is cheaper.,2
119cdb0f-002c-48de-ab71-a1da615db84c,Should have been a one time payment. The monthly subscription price is way too high. The app isn't something i would pay more than 2dollars for.,2
e84e566e-49b2-4d04-aeb5-f7c111a8b6f3,"We should be warned that the trial period has ended and we should upgrade the app I just downloaded to test And forgot it After seven days, the surprise!! Charged in 30 dollars (something like that) Many other applications just end they free trial and ask for the premium signature. I don't know if automatically charge after free trial is a thing of google; if it is, in my opinion it's completely wrong. The client should be asked if really want to purchase. However, the app is nice.",2

d42c8286-f3e9-41e2-a71d-6dafcebaa6c1,"It looks decent, good interface and idea but once you find your way around the immediate ads and attempts to sell you a subscription, you are very limited. You can only have around 4 habits before it tells you that you've reached your limit (and to pay to get more). Not worth it at all. Suggestions: allow 10 free habits, lower the subscription price (a lot).",2

94cca843-606f-4312-a510-cf9c33ffb396,It seems good but too expensive. 600rs per month for a habit tracking app is too much I'd say. At least a lifetime purchase option should be there. Nobody likes to subscribe to every single thing they're using.,2
