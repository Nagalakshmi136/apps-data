The idea behind showing streaks is that it's like a little reward, so the fact that it says you've broken your streak when you haven't is pretty frustrating. If you're going to allow for habits that only happen 5 days a week (for example), then the streak feature needs to be set up so that the 2 days you don't plan to do it don't count as breaking the streak.
