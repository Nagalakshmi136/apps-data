There are a few things that would make it much better, though - being able to alter the penalty level for missing dailies, being able to set dailies for once a week without picking a specific day, being able to earn gems without premium, and being able to label/colour code tasks would make this a full five stars.",4 stars

Working hard for just collecting stuff and never getting to actually quest. My pending should keep rolling over until I get a turn. I should get a turn.,2 stars

75660faa-30bc-458d-afd3-583e6e81109e,Great for ADHD - it really helped me organize my tasks and gave me motivation to finish them. Unfortunately it's very unforgiving if you fail your tasks. If you hit zero health the game says you'll lose your progress on your current level but neglects to mention that it also takes all your gold and deletes one of your items. That was enough to get me to quit the app altogether since losing limited gear I worked hard to get was extremely demoralizing.May try it again if they make it less punitive,3 stars

My only criticism is that you have to use gems to change your class; I selected mage but pretty much immediately realized that I'd already invested a bunch of money into warrior gear and that I'd be better off just going with warrior, but since it's pretty hard to earn gems (I honestly don't know how) I can't change it. It's not a terrible inconvenience besides the fact that I levelled up the available warrior items (like axe and helmet) and now cannot further invest. It's merely disappointing that I'm stuck now. But, besides that, the app is super great. I really like the pets function (I dunno what they do, but they're cute!) and the quests give you some kind of goal to work towards (and thankfully, you can complete them by yourself). Plus, they're not a required feature! You can just use Habitica for keeping track of tasks if you want, which is awesome.",4 stars

Habitica responded: HabitRPG, Inc.December 23, 2020 Hi AFK, thanks for your review! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback. Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That ""About"" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the ""Send feedback"" does not even exist in the app. It's called ""Report a bug"". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also ""Report A Bug"" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all. It's gotta count for something.",1 star

However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail.

289f8e1d-7abf-4344-9ffc-79cfba4f543a,"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",3 stars

Android and web. 2. Lists within todo to break down bigger tasks. 3. The instant gratification of finishing a todo. Several tips: 1. Toggl chrome extension works with habitica to track time, with the popular pomodoro timer. 2. Add a simple daily, like brush teeth, to help start. 3. Create a bedtime routine daily.",4 stars

I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time. This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used. The avatars are hideous. The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections. It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality. The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection. Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item. Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

Friendly competition and cooperation keep things interesting and encouraging. Quests are wonderful long term motivation, along with the goal of filling the stable.

I lost health overnight because it didn't let me check off my dailies? Especially frustrating during quests.

6805cee3-2b31-411e-8463-b0e16c6f2f99,"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ‚óèMake the quests you can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not much to do otherwise. ‚óè Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with gold). ‚óèOffline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ‚óèHave the ability to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a grind. ‚óèHave a little more customization available from the start (maybe a freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",2 stars

This really keeps me engaged and helps me to organize my life in the same Fell Swoop. My only suggestions are 1. I wish I could have a way of having someone in my party close to me, like my fiance, be allowed to make requests of me by putting things on my to-do list in exchange for a prize or some other kind of offering on their part. This takes out the constant reminders she tries to give me and requests she makes of me when I'm not really paying attention and often don't feel like taking the time or I'm not in a position to put these new things on my to-do list. 2. I see a use for having checklists available in the habits category. 3. It would be extremely motivating if there was a way to see a list of the things that I've finished and when I finished them. This way I can keep track of my productivity overall and perhaps even show someone my productivity if it were ever put into question. Also I don't know what to do about a finger slip if I hit something and I don't even know what the task was I just know that I didn't rightly finish the task.

In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",2 stars

The layout is not very well thought out, I personally don't think the sprites are good looking (albeit that is admittedly a deeply subjective opinion which I am not asking be changed), and the mobile app in particular has a lot of trouble syncing your tasks if you add another task on your PC. I added one to-do to the list on pc yesterday, but it has yet to show up in the app, despite numerous refreshes and attempts to sync the two. That, in my opinion, is a big flaw.

You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault. I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy.

Now when I log in for the day, it either takes a while for it to catch up and show the ""start your day"", or it doesn't load at all and my character and party suffer because of it. On the bright side I'm starting to fall into the habits I want, so it's almost worth it. Some of the graphics look nice, but the character you get to customize looks kinda wonky(?) and the options for it are limited until you can buy more clothes n such with the in-game currency.

That way you don't have to get punished for not doing it nor do you have to lie and say you did it. I know there's the tavern but it's not the same.,3 stars

Once I had equipment, a pet, and a mount I liked there was very little remaining to keep me engaged. I can't recommend using it single player. I am aware there are guilds to help you meet parties so you can adventure but I am disinclined to meet strangers just to keep my tasks organized. Also I'll note that the penalties for not engaging in dailies are so minimal that I was never worried about skipping anything... and since the benefits are randomized (apparently heavily towards potion and foods, not eggs) I wasn't incentivized to try for any specific type of activity beyond things I just wanted to get done.",2 stars

The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it.

Habitica does more though. It actually motivates me as well as providing accountability. Because for some reason just being an adult is not enough motivation.

After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",2 stars

I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task.

A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother.

However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.

18afe1a4-8ddd-4716-ae30-6a36fffc73e1,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did.",2 stars

Android Wear support would be nice. I know that might be a nother app, but if the widget had functionality it could be used, via an android wear app called Widget, that let's you put your widgets on your watch. Currently the only widget that is functional is the habit widget since you only need to click the button, but dailies and todos require opening and checking the lists which the widget can't do. Updating the widget would cover both widget users and watch users. It would work great if there was only one widget that you swipe left and right to move through habits, todos, and dailies, up and down to move through tasks in each category, and adding the option to expand and click checkboxes.",5 stars

People who need a holding hand to stay motivated (those who install this app) shouldn't be given too much power. 2) the exp gain is completely uncontrollable and can be abused, no daily cap whatsoever. The daily exp cap could at least be some kind of a max gauge meter point, which would be a good decision helper in terms of ""how much exp should i get for doing X"" and distributing your daily task load. 3)it takes progressively more exp for new levels and it only makes sense in mmo, not real life. Irl it depends very much on what you're doing, and getting less levels for doing same things could be demotivating. 4)need better char models and more customization.

After you delete a habit, it will still show up in the list and when you press on the deleted item, the new task activity will show up unless you sync manually. This will make the UI extremely confusing. it will be much better if you simply do a sync automatically in the background whenever a new habit or daily is added.

And you can improve and succeed at any given subject or life area. All you have to do is set a habit/daily/to-do and classify it into a category of your choice. You can interact with other groups of people playing the game, and you can get into challenges. I already feel better after using for just a couple of weeks. They just sent a new update so I'll give you a better review after a month or so of deliberate use. Don't download other apps. Don't download to-do lists, habit trackers and similar apps. Download habitica, it makes you get things done. Awesome productivity app. Should be a top developer.",4 stars

But each 'quest' is a text-based little paragraph story that progresses a little bit every day based on how much of your list you or your 'party' group check off. It's either collecting things or beating up some sort of monster, and it literally takes as little time as you want it to. The $5 in-game purchases are cosmetic, not needed at all.

The quest system, while not being perfect, allows me and my kids to enjoy seeing our work on tasks produce some results. The whole system does have some draw-backs, although being a community project, it understandable. The main drawback for me is the options for recurrance of tasks. You can either select the days for it to occur on by themselves, or select for it to repeat every x number of days. This is workable, however, certain tasks need to be done on certain days of the month, and since each month has a different amount of day, saying to repeat every 30 days does not work perfectly.

23885653-64a0-41a3-bb65-5ce80c9678b2,"A world of difference! Some time ago, I downloaded this app when it was still called HabitRPG. It was clunky and in early development so I didn't hold onto it for long. Never would I have guessed that, over two years later (give or take) it would have developed so much! The outlay is beautiful and aesthetically appealing. There are a plethora of things to do within the app itself with that list ever-growing. I am very fond of the checklists that have become a central focus as well. As a novelist, there are many pieces to the writing process. Many apps lack the option to list in parts which quickly becomes problematic. Instead of neatly being able to find a certain item, I am stuck digging through either the list itself or tags to find it. That is ten minutes or more of wasted time. Habitica allows me to organize everything neatly, filing it away beneath one point. Perfect for long-standing novels, shopping lists and more!

021f5d10-bd67-4758-b93f-eb92daf3c7c9,"A much nicer design than the original app. Very good mobile companion. However, it would be nice if the add button in the bottom right corner would be movable or moved. As it is right now, it covers the purchase item for the last reward if the list extends long enough.",4 stars
51a7794f-b88c-40f1-bbf1-3ff245f80780,Good so far- just a few more things need to be added before this can fully rival the website version. Far more responsive and faster than the old app. Keep it up!,4 stars

adefd674-5e28-463d-b946-44082625d4fe,"The UI is very attractive. My only gripe so far is that images don't show up in task names yet. Also, is there any chance of being able to set notifications for individual habits, dailies,and todos? I would love a feature like that.",4 stars

ac42a83e-91fb-4602-8928-024ca8d02abe,"I tried the older HabitRPG app and found it buggy, slow, and missing important functionality. The new/updated version has improved in all of those areas: much less buggy, faster & more responsive, and has far more functionality. There are still a few bits of missing functionality (e.g. filtering dailies by due/gray) so I only gave it 4 stars. But solid & usable.",4 stars
